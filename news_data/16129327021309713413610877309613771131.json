(Contributed)\n\nTalking about his 9th birthday, Damien Smith is a boy of few words, but all of them are filled with joy.\n\nTuesday, November 24, 2020, marked a most memorable birthday for the young Canoe resident who, thanks to his mother Tiffanie Trudell and father Thomas Smith, was able to celebrate with the knowledge that many others were celebrating with him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in tears almost this whole time so I\u2019m exhausted from crying,\u201d said Trudell, whose tears of joy began falling on Saturday when she and Thomas revealed to their son the results of \u201cDamien\u2019s Birthday Project.\u201d\n\nThe project began in October, approximately two weeks after the family moved to the area, with a public post on Facebook. In it, Thomas and Trudell explained Damien\u2019s birthday was coming up and how, when asked if he was excited about it, the eight-year-old replied, \u201cNo, I\u2019m just going to be lonely.\u201d\n\nTo remedy this, and the fact that a birthday party was looking unlikely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the heartbroken parents asked if anyone would be interested in sending their son birthday cards in the mail.\n\nThose broken hearts were quickly filled with happiness as people from all over the world began responding to their post. Soon, Thomas and Trudell were making clandestine trips to the post office, gathering bundles of envelopes and parcels addressed to their son while trying not to spoil the surprise.\n\nAnd then came the message from Canadian celebrity and Deadpool star Ryan Reynolds. With Damien being a big fan of Reynold\u2019s \u201cmerc with the a mouth,\u201d friends of the family helped bring Thomas and Trudell\u2019s post to Reynolds\u2019 attention.\n\nTrudell said it was at dinner time when she received a text from Reynolds and learned he\u2019d be sending her son a special video message. She and Thomas finally got to share that video with Damien over the weekend.\n\n\u201cFrozen,\u201d is how Damien said he felt while watching as Reynolds spoke directly to him.\n\nTrudell, who has been brought to tears on more than one occasion by Reynolds\u2019 involvement, said she expected his video message might be more humorous and light. While some of that is there, it is also personal, emotional and supportive.\n\nRead more: Ryan Reynolds text almost gives away Shuswap boy\u2019s birthday surprise\n\nRead more: \u2018I\u2019m just going to be lonely\u2019: Shuswap family asks for help celebrating son\u2019s birthday\n\n\u201cIt was the most perfect video I could have ever expected,\u201d said Trudell. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to joke and be like, \u2018ha ha happy birthday,\u2019 but to really pull himself down from his stardom and be like, \u2018I have been where you are,\u2019 that was a really beautiful thing that he did for my son \u2013 To take the time out of his day just to say, \u2018Hey, you\u2019re just like me.\u2019\u201d\n\nOn the Deadpool theme, Damien also received a Deadpool birthday cake by Amanda Gage of Cake Creations. The Shuswap chapter of Bikers are Buddies, whose members took part in a community birthday parade that drove past Damien\u2019s home over the weekend, also gave him a Leap Pad which, along with the cards, are to help Damien with his reading.\n\nTiffanie and Thomas have been reading the cards, received from Ireland, Russia, Mexico, Scotland, the U.S. and, of course, Canada, together with Damien. They also plan on sending out thank-you cards.\n\nBack home from school on his birthday, Damien had only one word to describe the celebrations so far: \u201cNuts!\u201d\n\nTrudell and Thomas are relieved they no longer have to keep Damien\u2019s Birthday Project a secret, and grateful for everyone who has contributed to the experience.\n\n\u201cSeeing Damien\u2019s face makes me feel like I\u2019ve done a good job as a mom\u2026,\u201d said Trudell.\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter\n\nSalmon Arm",
