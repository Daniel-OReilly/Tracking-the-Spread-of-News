I know I live in a special place when I can wakesurf at 6 am before heading off to work.\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s no surprise that when asked what he\u2019s passionate about outside of work, he says that being active outdoors is important to him.\n\n\u201cI have been skiing my entire life and love the freedom of charging down the mountain.\u201d Kyle is also passionate about music, enjoying a wide range of genres, from reggae to rock and everything in between, as well as audio books that cover business, biographies and personal development. And because that\u2019s not quite enough, he\u2019s also into working out, Thai boxing and meditation!\n\nWhen it comes to style, and with \u201cbig-city corporate\u201d behind him, Kyle is loving that he can lean into the casual side of work wear, with Adidas sneakers replacing dress shoes and denim replacing the suit jacket. He jokes that he feels that he\u2019s finally made it because he wore shorts to work for the first time ever last summer!\n\nAsked for the best life lesson he\u2019s recently learned, he says, \u201cBeing grateful for the people in my life, living in the moment and learning how to expand my comfort zones.\u201d\n\nClothes/Grooming\n\nFavourite denim, brand and cut: DUER performance denim, slim fit.\n\nCurrent go-to clothing item: Rip Curl fleece.\n\nFavourite pair of shoes: Adidas Busenitz Pro Shoes.\n\nBest new purchase: Axis boat.\n\nFavourite day-bag: Black Diamond ski backpack.\n\nSunglasses: Ray-Ban.\n\nScent: Million by Paco Rabanne.\n\nNecessary indulgence: Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cup Blizzard.\n\nFavourite skincare product: Tamanu oil.\n\nFavourite hair product: Layrite Pomade.\n\nStyle Inspirations & Life\n\nLast great read: Can\u2019t Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds by David Goggins.\n\nBook currently reading: Little Black Stretchy Pants by Chip Wilson.\n\nFavourite book of all time: Awareness by Anthony de Mello.\n\nFavourite artist: My mother, Sharon Lawrence.\n\nPiece of art: Bamboo Study, by Sharon Lawrence.\n\nFavourite fashion designer or brand: DUER performance denim.\n\nFavourite musician: Stick Figure.\n\nEra of time that inspires your style: 90s surf/skate culture.\n\nFavourite local restaurant: Naked Caf\u00e9.\n\nFavourite cocktail or wine: Anything but a Caesar!\n\nFavourite current song: Just Livin\u2019 by Sensi Trails.\n\nAlbum on current rotation: KBong and Island Reggae Radio on Spotify.\n\nFavourite city to visit: Maui.\n\nFavourite hotel: The Westin Maui Resort & Spa, Ka\u2019anapali.\n\nFavourite App: Spotify and Audible.\n\nFavourite place in the whole world: Hawaii.\n\nOkanagan",
