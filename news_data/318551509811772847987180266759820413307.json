(Contributed Photo/Tina Francis)\n\nA man raised in Agassiz has found his calling among the rocks and clear blue waters of Cayoosh Creek.\n\nAlong his journey of sobriety after a long battle with drug and alcohol addiction, Renegade Prospectors co-founder Rick Curiston \u2013 now loving life in Lillooet \u2013 hopes to turn his prospecting passion into a new career.\n\nCuriston\u2019s skills in video editing and creating content he developed as a DJ spurred him on to create a YouTube channel, documenting his new-found love of small-scale mining and prospecting.\n\n\u201cEveryone in Agassiz would most remember me as the crazy DJ that partied all night, and I was in the festival scene for many years before COVID,\u201d he said.\n\nThe name Renegade Prospectors is a reference to his former annual festival \u201cWeekend Renegade.\u201d\n\n\u201cI smoked crack for 11 years,\u201d Curiston said. \u201cI\u2019ve been clean for eight. I found prospecting 11 months ago, and I\u2019ve been sober for a year.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll always be an addict, but now it\u2019s for gold,\u201d he added.\n\nCuriston and his fiancee Tina Francis made a pact to get sober together and stuck to it. The Renegade Prospectors logo contains a nod to the couple\u2019s past; the web in the dream catcher resembles the dopamine molecule. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter linked to the brain\u2019s pleasure centre and plays a key role in the forming of habits, both good (socializing, eating properly) and bad (gambling, addiction).\n\nREAD ALSO: Local miner eyes Bear Mountain for gold\n\nHe vividly remembers the first time he found his first piece of gold while panning along Cayoosh Creek.\n\n\u201cProspecting takes us to a whole new level,\u201d Curiston said. \u201cThe high I got from seeing that [first piece of gold] \u2013 shake [the pan] back, and bang! There it was. I jumped right up and yelped.\u201d\n\nCuriston hopes to incorporate parts of his First Nations ancestry in his YouTube channel \u2013 also named Renegade Prospectors \u2013 speaking on local legends in addition to showcasing his prospecting finds. He hopes to turn his channel and his hobby prospecting into a career.\n\nProspecting, hobby mining and panning for gold is the trendy new hobby in the Cayoosh Creek area, according to Curiston.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s booming right now because of COVID; we\u2019ve bumped into a lot of people, all newbies,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else to do!\u201d\n\nAfter seeing Curiston and Francis\u2019s success, the couple\u2019s received private messages across social media looking for their expertise in the hobby.\n\nAgate seems to be their most common find.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge on agate,\u201d Curiston said of the Cayoosh Creek area. Agate is a volcanic rock that melds chalcedony and quartz.\n\nPrior to venturing out, Curiston looks for irregularities and coloration in the land using Google Earth to help him determine where to look next.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t found \u2018nothing\u2019 yet. Every time, it works,\u201d Curiston said.\n\nThen, off he goes treasure hunting with Francis, 4-year-old daughter Paisley and loyal canine friend Biscuit.\n\n\u201c[Paisley] even has her own hat, vest, gear and tools for digging agates and amethyst,\u201d Curiston said. \u201cShe\u2019s still the holder of the best purple piece of amethyst to date! Due to her being so close to the ground, she finds the really nice stuff.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: B.C. museum receives donation of 52-million-year-old fossils\n\nAmong their biggest hauls is a 35-pound piece of agate and amethyst chunks the size of Curiston\u2019s fist. He described the first amethyst find as a \u201cpocket glowing with purple inside.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was it, all high fives,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe started chiseling; it\u2019s took two and a half hours to get it out of super hard, hard rock. It was super, super dense rock, but it was very worth it.\u201d\n\nFrancis is enrolled in online schooling for business skills and has been working on building blogs. She crafts pendants \u2013 doing everything from polishing to cutting gems to assembling the pendants themselves \u2013 from the agate they find while prospecting and has sold a few already to friends and family.\n\nWhen they\u2019re not treasure hunting, the family likes to fish for trout and hike, exploring familiar trails, relics and old mining sites possibly hearkening back to the days of the Cayoosh Creek Gold Rush in the late 1800s.\n\nCuriston and Francis have been posting videos since late August on YouTube, garnering just under 40 subscribers so far. Their Facebook page is more active with more than 100 followers as of publication; the page features photos of their finds, video briefs out in the field and articles about mining and prospecting. They have also set up a Patreon page for those who want to support their work and content.\n\n\u201cThanks to those who have helped me, guided me into the world of prospecting and who have supported me along the way,\u201d Curiston wrote on Facebook at the one year sober mark. \u201cI appreciate every one of you. Life has changed a lot in the past few years and I\u2019m so happy I can live every day now, clean and sober.\u201d\n\nDo you have something to add to this story, or something else we should report on?
