And she\u2019s in the midst of an entirely new career.\n\n\u201cI worked for the RCMP for 18 years and took an early retirement due to severe PTSD from being exposed to a lot of terrible things,\u201d she says. \u201cWhile getting my mind healthy and gaining back control of my life, I decided to take on something completely different, but something I\u2019ve always been interested in.\u201d\n\nShe partnered with Dr. Cory Brown to develop Skin Sense Laser Aesthetics. Jennifer, a medical aesthetician, treats clients with scarring, pigment disorders, sun damage, acne and wrinkles using a variety of applications, including ICON and TempSure lasers, intense pulse light, micro-needling and more.\n\n\u201cI love that I\u2019m always learning and developing my mind and new skills,\u201d she says. \u201cEqually gratifying is being able to apply everything I\u2019ve learned to help people unlock the beauty they possess inside, and giving them the confidence to shine. I love working closely with each and every one of my clients, earning their trust and learning their stories. Nothing is more rewarding than seeing my clients\u2019 eyes light up when they see the beauty within themselves!\u201d\n\nThe 7 Sins\n\nEnvy:\n\nWhose shoes would you like to walk in?\n\nIf I have learned one thing over the last few years, it is to never want to be anyone other than the best version of myself. Social media tends to depict sensationalized or embellished portrayals of other people\u2019s lives, which is hard not to get caught up in. Finding confidence in who you are\u2014and being able to love the person you are\u2014holds far more value than wanting to be something that isn\u2019t genuine.\n\nGluttony:\n\nWhat is the food you could eat over and over again?\n\nCharcuterie and a full-bodied red Okanagan wine!\n\nGreed:\n\nYou\u2019re given $1 million that you have to spend selfishly. What would you spend it on?\n\nTravel! I would love to travel through Italy, experiencing the culture, art, food and wines with my family.\n\nWrath:\n\nPet peeves?\n\nWhen you park your vehicle far away from any other vehicle in a parking lot, and someone decides it would be a good idea to park right beside\u2014super close to\u2014the only other vehicle around!\n\nSloth:\n\nWhere would you spend a long time doing nothing?\n\nIn bed curled up with my French bulldog, Eve, watching Netflix.\n\nPride:\n\nWhat is the one thing you\u2019re secretly proud of?\n\nI am so proud of my resilient little family. No matter what life event is thrown at us, we have stood by each other and persevered. And because of it, we have shared an incredible life together.\n\nLust:\n\nWhat makes your heart beat faster?\n\nIt definitely doesn\u2019t fit the description of \u201clust,\u201d but what makes my heart beat faster is cooking an amazing meal for family and friends, bringing us all together.\n\nLifestyle",
