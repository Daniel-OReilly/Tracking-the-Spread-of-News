    "content": "Mike Dangeli is a Tsimshian, Nisga\u2019a and Tlingit artist and community leader.\n\nHe recently carved a memorial totem pole for missing and murdered Indigenous women, and he lead the raising ceremony for the totem pole on Kitsumkalum territory on Sept. 4.\n\nThe 47-year-old father of three lives in Terrace with his wife Mique\u2019l and their son Hayetsk, who is nearly a year old. Dangeli has two older sons, Nick and Michael, who are in their twenties.\n\nDangeli has been immersed in Northwest Indigenous culture and making art since he was a boy, but he walked a long path before becoming an established, full-time artist.\n\nHe was born in the tiny village of Stella, Missouri, near an army base where his biological father was stationed. His family only stayed a few months there \u2014 they moved often due to military obligations. When his parents separated, Dangeli moved with his mom to California, Washington State and finally, southern Alaska.\n\nGrowing up, he spent time in southern Alaska and northern B.C., having family roots on both sides of the border.\n\nIn the summers, he spent countless hours on a boat fishing with his Nisga\u2019a grandfather, who instructed him in Nisga\u2019a adaawk (oral history) and ayuuk (laws and protocol). He also learned from his grandmother, who was a gifted artist.\n\n\u201cNot only did she do beading and weaving and leather work, but she also was a landscape painter as well as a portrait painter,\u201d he said. \u201cHer and my mom were my first art teachers.\u201d\n\nRelatives also instructed him in the Tsimshian and Tlingit cultures. On the Tlingit side, he learned to make drums, which he traded for regalia, knowledge or tools.\n\nAs a teenager, Dangeli played varsity football in Alaska and continued his cultural education on both sides of the border.\n\nWhen he was 17, he enlisted with the United States Army (to his mother\u2019s dismay), inspired by a long family history of military service. Many of his uncles served in Vietnam and Korea, including his uncle Bill, a marine who fought in the Fall of Saigon in 1975. Both of Dangeli\u2019s grandfathers fought in the Second World War. A great-grandfather on his mother\u2019s side was a member of the Alaska Territorial Guard.\n\nDangeli served 10 years and did four tours of combat. He served in the Army Airborne, the Army Air Assault, and the Army Rangers. Those tours were through the UN\u2019s involvement in the Somali Civil War, during the First Gulf War and at several other locations he cannot discuss.\n\nConfidentiality agreements prevent him from publicly speaking about much of his time in the military, but he left with an honourable discharge.\n\nDangeli has grown critical of his time in the military.\n\n\u201cI tell my sons, I\u2019ve been shot and stabbed and chewed enough dirt on foreign soil and fought enough that they don\u2019t have to,\u201d he said. \u201cI look at where I was deployed and who sent me there, and it\u2019s always rich politicians who are sending poor people off to war. I think that\u2019s the way it\u2019s been since the beginning of time. But I just don\u2019t agree with the politics of where they\u2019re sending us as soldiers, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re really fighting for freedom and everything like we\u2019re being told we are.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still support our troops, because it\u2019s not their choice. They\u2019re not wanting to go do this. They\u2019re just following orders.\u201d\n\nBeing in the military meant missing out on some of his oldest son\u2019s early years, something Dangeli regretted.\n\n\u201cI had him so young and then of course being deployed or away so many times, I felt like I missed a lot. And as a father, you know, that\u2019s a pop in the chops,\u201d he said. \u201cI was able to reconnect and having some amazing time with him as a young pre-teen and teenager and all the way up into his adulthood.\u201d\n\nReturning to civilian life was a difficult transition for Dangeli, as it is for so many soldiers. He carried a lot of pain home, but culture and tradition kept him grounded.\n\n\u201dKnowing who I am, as far as being a Nisga\u2019a/Tlingit/Tsimshian man, and practising my people\u2019s traditions from an early age, being immersed in them \u2026 I really feel like helped me survive all of that,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when I came home with lots of baggage, and was angry about some of the things I had to do in combat. The culture and the art saved my life.\u201d\n\nDangeli used the American GI Bill to go back to school in Alaska. He worked as a fisherman and in tourism. He transferred to school in Washington State where, for a time, he was intent on becoming a history teacher. He did an intensive carving apprenticeship under David Boxley, a Tsimshian artist from Metlakatla, Alaska.\n\nThen he went through a difficult divorce. Hurting from that, and still bearing some pain from his years of service, Dangeli planned to return to the Nass Valley to lick his wounds. But first he stopped off in Vancouver, where he needed to earn a little cash.\n\nHe was asked to complete a totem pole that had been abandoned halfway through the carving process. The original carvers, who seemed to struggle with addiction issues, took an initial payment for work on the pole and then disappeared. Subsequently, the totem pole was stolen twice, ending up on Vancouver Island at one point. It was beaten with a baseball bat. Somebody spray painted a racist name for Indigenous people on it.\n\nDangeli related to the beat-up pole.\n\n\u201cIt just was abused, so I saw it as a physical manifestation of where I was at,\u201d he said.\n\nHe ended up getting a grant to have 12 youth work with him on the totem pole project. He taught them how to hold a traditional pole-raising potlatch, how to make gifts for the potlatch, and other protocols.\n\nAs many as 500 kids from the Vancouver area came by to help work on the totem pole itself.\n\n\u201cIt ended up being this really beautiful moment,\u201d Dangeli said.\n\nAfter that, the friendship centre where he had been carving invited him to stay a while, to hold some workshops and things of that nature. He ended up living in the Lower Mainland for 20 years.\n\nHe met his wife, Mique\u2019l, when they both apprenticed under the same master carver. Among many other activities over the years, they traveled the world with their dance group Git Hayetsk. They danced all over North America, including on Broadway, and they danced in Germany, Japan and Malaysia.\n\nA few years ago, Dangeli and his wife were both invited to work and teach at \u2018Na Aksa Gyilak\u2019yoo School in Kitsumkalum, so they moved to Terrace. They\u2019ve been here since.\n\nNormally the family are quite busy, working on various art projects, teaching or speaking engagements, or cultural activities on both sides of the border. But with COVID-19 and the border closure, they are having a relatively quiet year.\n\nDangeli wished he could have seen his older sons more this year, but he relishes being able to spend quality time at home, especially with his son Hayetsk being at a formative age. Hayetsk has been immersed in his father\u2019s artwork this year, participating in carving in his own way. The little guy is already beginning to learn the cultural lessons that saved his father years ago.\n\n\u201dHe loves coming in when I\u2019m in my painting studio, coming and looking over things,\u201d Dangeli said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty amazing to see this little toddler emulate so much of what is going on in his life.\u201d",
