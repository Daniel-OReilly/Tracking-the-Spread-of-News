It\u2019s not my planet anymore. I have way less time to live with the consequences of my vote than my children do.\n\nWe support our children in so many ways. Voting is another. Ask your children how they are voting and why, so you know they\u2019ve done their research. Then vote with them (or the majority of them). You increase the impact of their vote and thus help them design their planet.\n\nCOMPLETE PROVINCIAL ELECTION COVERAGE\n\nIt\u2019s a complete reversal of the power dynamic.\n\nIf you\u2019re a younger voter, be brave and tell your elders how you want them to support you.\n\nIt\u2019s long past time younger voters mattered more.\n\nHey, older voters \u2014 let\u2019s do this!\n\nTom Rankin\n\nKamloops\n\n\n\neditor@interior-news.com\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter\n\nBC politicsBC Votes 2020Election 2020",
