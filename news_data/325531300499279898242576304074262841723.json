For good measure, stadium title sponsor FedEx called on the team to come up with a moniker that would be more in tune with the current times rather than, say, the 1800s.\n\nSo, while Washington\u2019s NFL team conducts what it calls a \u201cthorough review\u201d that almost will surely lead to a replacement by 2021 at the latest, let\u2019s explore a few possibilities:\n\nGENERALS \u2014 This would be a nod to the lovable losers who spent decades serving as the Harlem Globetrotters\u2019 nightly pushovers, compiling a record of one win and somewhere north of 16,000 losses before they went out of business in 2015. Washington\u2019s NFL team hasn\u2019t been quite that bad in recent years, but it did go 3-13 a year ago and last won a playoff game in 2005. If Generals doesn\u2019t work out, how about the Federals? They were Washington\u2019s entry in the USFL during the 1980s, going 7-29 over two seasons in the ill-fated spring football league. A seamless transition, that would be.\n\nGRIDLOCK \u2014 The District of Columbia has some of the worst traffic congestion in the nation, so this would seem fitting to all those commuters who\u2019ve been spent roughly the time it takes to play an NFL game just trying to get to work. Also, it sums up our current political climate.\n\nBLAZE \u2014 During the War of 1812, the British invaded Washington and set fire to numerous government buildings including the White House and the Capitol. Not necessarily a proud moment in the nation\u2019s history, but probably a notch above Dan Snyder\u2019s embarrassing tenure as team owner.\n\nBUREAUCRATS \u2014 The team could pay tribute to all those nameless workers who keep the wheels of government droning along through turbulent times. They\u2019ve certainly shown more imagination than some of Washington\u2019s offensive schemes over the past couple of decades.\n\nFOGGY BOTTOM BOYS \u2014 Foggy Bottom is one of the city\u2019s oldest neighbourhoods, which would give Washington\u2019s NFL team a chance to play off the fictional band created for the Coen Brothers\u2019 classic movie \u201cO Brother, Where Art Thou?\u201d The Soggy Bottom Boys were fronted by a lip-syncing George Clooney, who hopefully could be persuaded to cut a video for the team\u2019s new right song, \u201cI Am a Man of Constant Sorrow.\u201d It\u2019s a catchier tune (and certainly more appropriate for the long-suffering fan base) than the hokey \u201cHail to the \u2026.\u201d\n\nBLOSSOMS \u2014 While perhaps lacking the machismo of other potential monikers, the city\u2019s famed cherry blossoms are in full bloom for roughly as long as the hopes of a Washington NFL fan each season. About two weeks.\n\nSENATORS \u2014 Washington\u2019s longtime baseball franchise was so horrible most years that its derisive motto became, \u201cFirst in war, first in peace, last in the American League.\u201d Hmm, that sounds familiar. Other names that were once used by pro sports franchises in the district include the Diplomats (a long-forgotten soccer team from the 1970s) and the Ambassadors (a team that never got off the ground in the World Football League). But forget about the Bullets, the NBA Wizards\u2019 former name. That one was dropped because of its association with gun violence. It ain\u2019t coming back.\n\nHOGS \u2014 This name hearkens back to the team\u2019s most glorious era, when a group of down-and-dirty behemoths dominated the offensive line of scrimmage and bullied Washington to three Super Bowl titles under Joe Gibbs. This might be the best way to appease those fans who are sure to object to changing the offensive moniker.\n\nMONUMENTS \u2014 C\u2019mon, how can you not like the Washington Monuments! A worthy tribute to the city\u2019s stunning array of marble and granite remembrances, which honour everyone from the first president to Martin Luther King Jr. to the veterans of the Vietnam War. Some great logo possibilities, for sure.\n\nRED TAILS \u2014 This is our pick. It maintains a link to the team\u2019s current abomination of a name but also salutes the famed Tuskegee Airmen, the group of African American fighter pilots who broke down racial stereotypes during World War II.\n\nFinally, Washington\u2019s NFL team would have a name everyone could cheer with pride.\n\nPaul Newberry, The Associated Press\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nWant to support local journalism?
