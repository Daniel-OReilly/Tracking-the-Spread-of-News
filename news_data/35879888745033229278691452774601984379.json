The species lives along B.C.\u2019s coast and travels as far south as California through the year.\n\nPHOTOS: 2nd calf in a month confirmed among Southern Resident killer whale pod\n\n@ashwadhwani\n\nashley.wadhwani@bpdigital.ca\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nWant to support local journalism?
