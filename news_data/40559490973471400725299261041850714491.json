A statement from the league says teams will be free to conduct on-ice activities until the holiday break begins on Dec. 19 so long as they abide by the provincial orders.\n\nThe league will announce a start date for the continuation of the season once further information from the provincial health officer comes through.\n\nRead More: Second wave, twice the anxiety; Okanagan paramedics reflect on pandemic from the front line\n\nRead More: COVID-19 cases on several Kelowna flights\n\n\u201cThe KIJHL appreciates the patience being shown by all league stakeholders, including our fans, sponsors, volunteers and facility partners, during a difficult and uncertain time,\u201d the statement from the league reads.\n\n\u201cWe are particularly grateful to the players, team staff and billet families who have worked diligently over the past three months to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all participants.\u201d\n\nThe KIJHL expressed hope that competitive play would return in January.\n\n\n\njim.elliot@saobserver.net\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter\n\nKIJHL",
