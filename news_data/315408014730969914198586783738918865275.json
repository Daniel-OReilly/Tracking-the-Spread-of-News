Montgomery\u2019s classic Canadian novel, at the Lester Centre on Feb. 25. (Photo by K-J Millar/The Northern View)\n\nTwelve talented local youth dancers joined the Toronto based Ballet Jorgen\u2019s world premier tour that brought to life the Canadian classic story, Anne of Green Gables, on Feb. 26. More than 300 audience members at the Lester Centre applauded the professional dance interpretation of the novel written by L.M. Montgomery.\n\nThe local youth stars participated with dance roles in the ensemble as furry woodland characters, a rabbit, skunk, toad, turtle, flowers and school children. The Prince Rupert troupe had just three weeks notice of their inclusion in the production.\n\n\u201cBallet Jorgen put out a general call to dance schools in every city they tour. We have to submit a written summary on each student we are presenting as they need to be disciplined in dance, \u201d Ella Ferland, director of Spectrum City Dance, said. \u201cIt is a quite a protocol to be accepted.\u201d\n\nThe local dancers don\u2019t have much time to rehearse and need to be adaptable.\n\n\u201cThe kids go to the rehearsals once the ballet comes to town. They are then incorporated into the production,\u201d Ferland said.\n\n\u201cWe were very happy at how well our dancers blended in on stage. The feed back from the professional dancers and the company itself was fantastic. They said the kids were able to adapt easily, which doesn\u2019t always happen,\u201d Ferland said.\n\n\u201cAll of our dancers were every excited to be part of this. It\u2019s a thrill to be on stage, its a thrill for them to watch the professional class. They treated the kids as peers. that was very happy making for the kids, \u201d Ferland said.\n\nBallet Jorgen is a Canadian classical ballet company that aims to make ballet accessible and relevant to 21st century audiences. They are dedicted to telling Canadian stories through the art of dance.\n\n\u201cTonight, this production proved how versatile Anne\u2019s story is, that it can touch hearts around the world, and warm spirits on a cold winter\u2019s night, \u201d Micheal Gurney, manager of the Lester Centre said.\n\nBallet Jorgen are on tour performing Anne of Green Gables for nine weeks in total, with six more to go, Callum McGregor, dancer with the company told Black Press.\n\nThe production carries with it 18 dancers, 5 crew and takes more than four hours to set up in each locale. The professional dancers have prepared every day since last May for this special journey through Western Canada. They each work on their roles from 9:30 to 6 p.m. everyday to ensure their dancing technique is spot on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a whirl wind and being on tour has taught me life lessons,\u201d McGregor whose first year it is with the company said. \u201cIt\u2019s the best experience being here, able to perform.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are going to continue to enjoy the tour,\u201d McGregor,who has been dancing for 14 years, said\n\nK-J Millar | Journalist\n\nemail\n\nLike the The Northern View on Facebook\n\nFollow us on Twitter Send K-JLike theonFollow us on\n\n\n\nSign up here Get local stories you won't find anywhere else right to your inbox.",
