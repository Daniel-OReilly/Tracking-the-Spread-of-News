After a further four films, he abandoned the role, before being enticed back to play him twice more, finally in 1983\u2019s \u201cNever Say Never Again.\u201d\n\nSir Sean Connery has died at the age of 90.

The ailment: stomach ulcers.\n\nBack in Edinburgh, he lifted weights to build his body and compete in the Mr. Universe contest. He came in third, briefly considered becoming a professional soccer player, but chose acting because he reasoned his career would last longer.\n\nREAD MORE: James Bond film release pushed back due to coronavirus\n\nHe got his first big break singing and dancing to \u201cThere is Nothing Like a Dame\u201d in \u201cSouth Pacific\u201d on the London stage and in a road production before going on to act in repertory, television and B movies.\n\nHe went to Hollywood for two early films, Disney\u2019s \u201cDarby O\u2019Gill and the Little People\u201d and \u201cTarzan\u2019s Greatest Adventure.\u201d\n\nWhen he decided to become an actor, he was told that Thomas Sean Connery wouldn\u2019t fit on a theatre marquee so he dropped his first name.\n\nThen came the audition that changed his life. American producers Albert \u201cCubby\u201d Broccoli and Harry Saltzman had bought the film rights to a string of post-World War II spy adventure novels by Ian Fleming.\n\nConnery was not their first choice for \u201cDr. No.\u201d The producers had looked to Cary Grant, but decided they wanted an actor would commit to a series. The producers also realized they couldn\u2019t afford a big-name star because United Artists had limited their film budget to $1 million a picture, so they started interviewing more obscure British performers.\n\nAmong them was the 6-foot-2 Connery. Without a screen test, Broccoli and Saltzman chose the actor, citing his \u201cdark, cruel good looks,\u201d a perfect match for the way Fleming described Bond.\n\nIt\u2019s the way many will always remember Bond.\n\nFor more news from B.C. and beyond delivered daily into your inbox, please click here.\n\nJill Lawless And Hillel Italie, The Associated Press\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter\n\nArts and EntertainmentMoviesObituaries",
