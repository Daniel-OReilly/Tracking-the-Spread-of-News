A number of vehicle entries occurred in November. (file photo)\n\nPrince Rupert RCMP is sending out a holiday reminder about the importance of locking and securing your vehicle, as well as removing any valuables while at home, at work, or out in public.\n\nWith Christmas shopping and purchases perhaps being stored in cars and vehicles they can be a temptation to would-be thieves.\n\n\u201cOver the month of November, the Prince Rupert RCMP responded to 10 reported thefts from motor vehicles. All of these investigations found that the vehicles were left unsecured,\u201d Cpl. Devon Gerrits said in a media release on Dec. 9.\n\n\u201cThese are crimes of opportunity that can be prevented by ensuring that you do your part by locking your vehicles when they are unoccupied,\u201d he said.\n\nGerrits told The Northern View more people have their vehicles sifted through than actually report.\n\n\u201cIt is always a good idea to report to the police as we have specialized sections such as Forensic\u2019s that could examine a vehicle for suspect fingerprints.\u201d\n\nThere is always the debate about locking vehicles as a theft deterrent versus keeping them unlocked to avoid unnecessary damage like a broken window or jimmied door locks. Gerrits said locking is better.\n\n\u201cI would recommend locking your vehicles, we hardly get any reports of people actually breaking into a vehicle \u2013 if any,\u201d Gerrits said. \u201cAlso if someone is worried about that concept, a good thing to do would be to remove any sort of valuables that would be visible.\u201d\n\nIf you see or notice any suspicious activity or observe a theft in progress please contact the Prince Rupert RCMP, or contact Crimestoppers at 1-800-222-8477 (TIPS) if you wish to remain anonymous.\n\nK-J Millar | Journalist\n\nemail\n\nLike the The Northern View on Facebook\n\nFollow us on Twitter Send K-JLike theonFollow us on",
