Or are you still?\n\nWell, you\u2019re not alone, according to YouTube trends expert Zaitoon Murji.\n\n\u201cWe definitely saw more people come to YouTube this year to deep dive into issues,\u201d Murji told Black Press Media by phone.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw, mostly, is that Canadians came to YouTube for content that met a specific personal need.\u201d\n\nThe top three reasons? To laugh, learn a new skill or to stay informed about what was happening around the world in 2020.\n\nThe year\u2019s top video certainly reflects the abundance of time that many Canadians had as they locked down, isolated and tried to get through the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe top video this year was an eight-part Ninja Warrior course to prevent squirrels from getting into a bird feeder,\u201d Murji said.\n\n\u201cThat might not be the type of video someone might make when they didn\u2019t have so much time on their hands.\u201d\n\nThat video, recorded by former NASA engineer Mark Rober, has had more than 50 million views since it was posted near the end of May.\n\nThe third video on YouTube\u2019s list of top trending videos was a parody video of a phrase that has made it onto masks, T-shirts and into the collective Canadian imagination this year.\n\nThat video was \u201cactually a parody video someone made from a press conference of Prime Minister Trudeau,\u201d Murji said.\n\nThat phrase?\n\n\u201cSpeaking moistly,\u201d Trudeau said, perhaps not on purpose, during a press conference in April.\n\n\u201cIt was an example of people trying to find humour in a really serious moments,\u201d Murji added.\n\nThe second video on the list of trending ones was, perhaps to no surprise to many, about gaming.\n\n\u201cThis was a very big year for gamers,\u201d she said. While streaming replaced what may have been live events in a pre-pandemic world, it also met another need: connection.\n\n\u201cWatching different creators do different gaming runs and then being able to implement or practice your own at home with that free time you did have.\u201d\n\nBut some of the viewing took a more serious turn. A Dave Chappelle video titled simply \u201c8:46\u201d came out in the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s death at the hands of Minneapolis police and in the midst of Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an example of the ways Canadians were looking to learn more about racial justice this year,\u201d Murji said.\n\nBut while Canadians were watching a lot more videos, they were also trying to not spend their whole year on their couches, and no YouTube creator demonstrates that more than MadFit, whose channel grew exponentially in 2020.\n\nAlso known as Maddie Lymburner, the Ontario-based creator got people moving, grooving and doing their squats in 2020.\n\n\u201cShe really took her channel and adapted it so that she was able to provide her online community with what they needed,\u201d Murji said.\n\n\u201cWhether that was doing workouts in a condo-sized space or trying a workout at with home products\u2026 knowing that most people didn\u2019t have workout equipment at home.\u201d\n\nAnd as the pandemic continues for its ninth month, Murji said there\u2019s been a bit of a shift in the videos blowing up on YouTube.\n\n\u201cEarlier this year, we saw a lot of \u2018workout with me, cook with me, clean with me,\u2019 that was really strong on the platform,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe way we saw that change a little bit is it turns into \u2018find a way with me\u2026 find a way to cope with me, find a way to meditate with me.\u2019 It shifted a little bit in that the need for connection became even stronger.\u201d\n\nALSO READ: Sorry, Grinch.
