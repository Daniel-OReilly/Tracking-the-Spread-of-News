THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck\n\nThe popular singer of O Canada at the Vancouver Canucks hockey games says he knew he might lose his job for standing up against what he describes as the \u201ctyranny\u201d of COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nMark Donnelly sang the anthem at an event called the Christmas Freedom Rally in Vancouver on Saturday, where hundreds of people protested restrictions imposed by B.C.\u2019s provincial health officer.\n\nVancouver Canucks owner Francesco Aquilini tweeted late Friday that Donnelly was now the former Canucks anthem singer, followed by the hashtag #wearamask.\n\nDonnelly told the crowd, many of whom weren\u2019t wearing masks or social distancing, that he decided to sing because he questions the \u201cdraconian lockdown protocols.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was originally sold as 15-day hunkering down sprint for the common good has turned into a 10-month marathon from hell, where the finish line is constantly being moved further into the distance,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he doesn\u2019t think health officials have done a cost-benefit analysis looking at the harms of the restrictions compared with preventing the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cAs someone known for singing our great national anthem, I\u2019m standing up against what I feel is tyranny, plain and simple,\u201d he said to applause and cheers from the crowd.\n\nDonnelly said his firing is censorship by an institution that he\u2019s followed for 50 years and been publicly associated with since 2001.\n\n\u201cSports figures, entertainers, politicians, et cetera, can stand for anything as long as it supports the narrative. You can support rioting, looting, destructions of livelihoods and reputation, but take a position against the narrative and you are worthy of exile or worse.\u201d\n\nDonnelly said he hasn\u2019t had direct contact with Aquilini or the Canucks and if he is no longer with the team, a phone call would have been a more respectful way to find out his reasons for taking part in the rally.\n\nHe had hoped the ownership and management of the Canucks would have had the \u201ccourage to support the freedom to express science-based position that is for the greater good of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nNo one from the Canucks responded to a request for comment.\n\nThe protesters then took to the streets in a march.\n\nVancouver police spokeswoman Tania Visintin said police need to exercise discretion with large groups of protesters violating public health orders, saying public safety is the priority.\n\nShe said mass arrests or ticketing could escalate an already tense situation.\n\n\u201cThis position does not automatically guarantee anyone special privileges at a protest. The bottom line is people who are contravening the public health order, they could be issued a ticket. Officers are using discretion with each situation that arises.\u201d\n\nB.C. health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said last month that she has \u201cno time for people who believe that wearing a mask somehow makes them ill or is a sign of lack of freedom.\u201d\n\nInstead, she said wearing a mask is about respect for those who suffering through the pandemic together.\n\n\u2014with files from News 1130.\n\nThe Canadian Press\n\nREAD MORE: Canucks unveil redesigned jersey as part of NHL\u2019s \u2018Reverse Retro\u2019 collection\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter\n\nCanucksCoronavirusvideo",
