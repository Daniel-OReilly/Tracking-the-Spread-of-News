Giannulli, the daughter of the \u201cFull House\u201d actor Lori Loughlin and fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, discussed on the Facebook Watch series \u201cRed Table Talk\u201d how she\u2019s been affected by the college admissions scandal involving her parents. (Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP, File)\n\nMaybe Olivia Jade Giannulli had hoped for kid-glove treatment in choosing the family vibe of \u201cRed Table Talk\u201d for her first public comments about the college admissions scandal involving her famous parents.\n\nIf so, she was quickly enlightened during Tuesday\u2019s episode of the Facebook Watch series.\n\n\u201cWhat were some of the repercussions throughout this whole situation?\u201d asked a skeptical Adrienne Banfield Norris, mom of series host Jada Pinkett Smith. \u201cBecause you\u2019re a beautiful young white woman who\u2019s been born into privilege, and there would be some people that would feel like, she\u2019ll be fine. I feel that way.\u201d\n\nGiannulli, 21, who admitted to nerves but said she considered the show a safe and open space, denied that she was seeking sympathy. Her parents, \u201cFull House\u201d actor Lori Loughlin and fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, are behind bars after pleading guilty to paying a half-million dollars to get Olivia Jade and sister Isabella, 22, into the University of Southern California as crew recruits, though neither were rowers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to victimize myself. I don\u2019t want pity. I don\u2019t deserve pity,\u201d Giannulli replied to Norris. \u201cWe messed up. I just want a second chance to be like, \u2018I recognize I messed up.\u2019 And for so long I wasn\u2019t able to talk about this because of the legalities behind it.\n\n\u201cI never got to say I\u2019m really sorry that this happened, or I really own that this was a big mess-up on everybody\u2019s part. But I think everybody feels that way in my family right now,\u201d said the onetime social influencer, who lost deals with prominent brands and left USC in the scandal\u2019s aftermath.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so important to me is \u2026 to learn from the mistake, not to be shamed and punished and never given a second chance,\u201d said an earnest Giannulli, dressed in a bright pink pantsuit.\n\nShe\u2019s said trying to overcome her sheltered perspective and find a way to contribute.\n\n\u201cI understand that I, just based off my skin colour, I already had my foot in the door and I was already ahead of everybody else. \u2026 I can recognize that going forward. I do want to do stuff to change that and to help that,\u201d she said, adding that had worked with children in an afterschool program in the Watts section of Los Angeles recently.\n\nPinkett Smith, who said she had agreed to bring Giannulli on her show over her mother\u2019s objections, struck an understanding tone with her. So did Pinkett Smith\u2019s daughter, Willow, also part of the series.\n\nGiannulli was asked about seeing both parents incarcerated.\n\n\u201cNo matter what the situation is, you don\u2019t want to see your parents go to prison\u2026. But also, I think it\u2019s necessary for us to move on and move forward,\u201d she said. She hasn\u2019t been in touch with either of them since they entered prison, which she said may have to do with COVID-19 quarantine restrictions.\n\nLoughlin began serving her two-month sentence in a federal prison in California on Oct. 30, while her husband\u2019s five-month term, also in the state, began Nov. 19. Plea deals also called for fines and community service for the pair.\n\nThey were among some 30 prominent people, including actor Felicity Huffman, to plead guilty in the case federal prosecutors dubbed Operation Varsity Blues. It uncovered hefty bribes to get kids into elite colleges with rigged test scores or fake athletic credentials.\n\nLynn Elber, The Associated Press\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nWant to support local journalism?
