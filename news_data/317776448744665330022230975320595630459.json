(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill)\n\nFred VanVleet bet on himself. It paid off.\n\nVanVleet agreed Saturday to a four-year, $85 million contract to remain with the Toronto Raptors, a person with direct knowledge of the discussions told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the contract remains unsigned.\n\nThe fourth year of the contract is at VanVleet\u2019s option, the person said.\n\nThe undrafted guard from Wichita State has played a huge role in the Raptors\u2019 recent successes, most importantly their run to the 2019 NBA championship. He has set career bests in scoring by wide margins in each of the last three seasons, that number rising to 17.6 points per game this past season.\n\nKeeping VanVleet was of major importance to the Raptors, who have won at least 50 games in each of the last five seasons \u2014 by far the longest current streak in the NBA. Milwaukee has a two-year such streak, and the reigning NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers reached the 50-win mark last season.\n\nIt also fulfilled a VanVleet prophecy: He famously went undrafted four years ago, then passed on some low-money deals that he figured wouldn\u2019t pan into much.\n\n\u201cI turned those down. I bet on myself,\u201d VanVleet told friends and family on what would have been his draft night, a festive occasion that turned disappointing when the call from the NBA never came.\n\nThe Raptors brought him in on a summer-league deal, then a minimum deal, then gave him a two-year contract for $18 million two years later \u2014 and now gave him the full reward.\n\nKyle Lowry, the veteran point guard and longtime leader of the Raptors, has predicted that VanVleet will take over that role one day. The deal agreed to on Saturday only cements that sort of thinking.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be rewarded,\u201d Lowry said after the Raptors were eliminated with a Game 7 loss to Boston in this past season\u2019s Eastern Conference semifinals. \u201cTo me, that means the world that he can take care of his family and take care of his family at a high level.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s no longer in doubt.\n\nFree agency opened in the NBA on Friday evening and VanVleet was one of the top available names. The Lakers\u2019 Anthony Davis remains unsigned though is expected to remain with the defending champions, and Gordon Hayward\u2019s future was another of the top questions remaining in the league as Day 2 of free agency began Saturday.\n\nVanVleet\u2019s deal was the second major development for the Raptors in two days. On Friday, the team announced that it would begin this season by calling Tampa, Florida, home because of travel issues related to the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 specifically the challenge of getting NBA teams over a U.S.-Canada border that is closed to nonessential travel.\n\nIn other matters Saturday:\n\nATLANTA\n\nThe Hawks added guard Kris Dunn on a two-year contract worth $10 million, a person with knowledge of the move told AP. That move came after Atlanta also landed Danilo Gallinari on Friday to a three-year contract.\n\nMIAMI\n\nMoe Harkless, who was briefly \u2014 on paper, anyway \u2014 a member of the Heat in July 2019 before getting moved as part of the trade that brought Jimmy Butler to Miami, is now with the Heat and for real this time.\n\nHarkless agreed to a $3.6 million contract, a person with knowledge told AP. For now, the Heat intend to use their biannual exception to land Harkless, who averaged 5.6 points in 62 games last season with the Los Angeles Clippers and New York.\n\n___\n\nTim Reynolds, The Associated Press\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nWant to support local journalism during the pandemic?
