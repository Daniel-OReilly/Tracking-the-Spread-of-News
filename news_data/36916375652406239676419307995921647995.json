He even offered a throwback to one of his infamous \u201990s-era lines, calling President Donald Trump a \u201cLooooosseer!\u201d to laughs and applause.\n\nCarrey and Rudolph each made an L out of their hands and held them to their foreheads and were joined by Alec Baldwin, reprising his role as Trump.\n\nAt one point, Baldwin sat at a piano and sang a few lines from Village People\u2019s \u201cMacho Man,\u201d a favourite of the president\u2019s late campaign rallies.\n\nHost Dave Chappelle opened his monologue by lighting a cigarette and calling it \u201ca pretty incredible day.\u201d\n\nHe quickly got serious, saying he was thinking about his great-grandfather, who was born a slave in South Carolina and after being freed, devoted his life to three things: \u201ceducation, freedom of Black people and Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could see him now, I wish he could see me,\u201d Chappelle said before launching into a joke about how his popular Comedy Central series was on two streaming services and he wasn\u2019t being paid for it.\n\n\u201cNow Trump is gone,\u201d Chappelle said, before joking about Trump\u2019s response to the coronavirus. He cited Trump\u2019s use of a racist name for the virus before saying, \u201cI\u2019m supposed to say that, not you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d aired a little over 12 hours after networks and The Associated Press declared Biden the winner of the 2020 election. The show quickly incorporated Harris\u2019 look from her and Biden\u2019s acceptance event.\n\nJoe and Kamala have a message for Donald Trump. pic.twitter.com/ybrPtFAyQM \u2014 Saturday Night Live \u2013 SNL (@nbcsnl) November 8, 2020\n\nThe highly-anticipated episode was delayed by the Clemson-Notre Dame game, which ran into double overtime, and in many markets, local news broadcasts.\n\nChappelle hosted \u201cSNL\u201d in November 2016 in its first episode after Trump\u2019s election, pointedly critiquing the surprise over the result.\n\n\u201cYou know, I didn\u2019t know Donald Trump was going to win the election,\u201d Chapelle said four years ago. \u201cI did suspect it. It seemed like Hillary was doing well in the polls and yet, I know the whites. You guys aren\u2019t as full of surprises as you used to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cSNL\u201d has regularly lampooned Trump and his presidency in recent years, enlisting Baldwin to play the commander in chief.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever been this overjoyed to lose a job before,\u201d Baldwin tweeted earlier Saturday.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nWant to support local journalism during the pandemic?
