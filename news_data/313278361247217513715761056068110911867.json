Children mark milestones as they conquer new challenges and face their fears. Parents connect, and find a comfortable space to ask advice. Playgrounds inspire healthy habits: getting outside, staying active and reaching out to socialize.\n\nWhat happens on a playground? Community.\n\nIt\u2019s not a surprise then, that the Prince Rupert Port Authority\u2019s Community Investment Fund has made a big commitment to parks and playgrounds since the fund\u2019s inception in 2009.\n\n\u201cProviding safe spaces for children to play and explore is imperative to their health and development,\u201d says Natalie Allen, Community Relations Coordinator with the Prince Rupert Port Authority. \u201cOver the past decade, the Community Investment Fund has facilitated the creation or enhancement of nearly a dozen play spaces, which are important assets to the many families who call the North Coast home.\u201d\n\nThis year, the Fund is celebrating ten years of completed community projects and looking ahead to future projects for generations to come.

Doug Kerr Field Restoration: Over the years Doug Kerr Field had become Prince Rupert\u2019s unofficial dog park, but a renewed local interest meant youth needed more space to play ball. Thanks to investments from the Prince Rupert Port Authority, other community partners and the tireless work of local volunteers, minor league baseball and softball are thriving in Prince Rupert.\n\nOver the years Doug Kerr Field had become Prince Rupert\u2019s unofficial dog park, but a renewed local interest meant youth needed more space to play ball.

Conrad Elementary School Accessible Playground: It was time for the school\u2019s playground equipment to be replaced, and thanks to an investment from the Prince Rupert Port Authority and other government and business partners, the school\u2019s playground saw expansion and improved accessibility too. It\u2019s the first park on the community\u2019s east side available to all children, including those with mobility limitations.\n\nFields and playgrounds across the North Coast share in the port\u2019s success, with nearly a dozen completed projects and more in the works!
