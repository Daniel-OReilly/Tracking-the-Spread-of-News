And I\u2019ve met so many fascinating people over the years, many of whom are now friends.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: BLVD TV Interviews Jason Binab from the Agency Victoria\n\nRiding has been another big part of Lisa\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been riding since I was about 10, and competing on the Hunter Jumper circuit since about 18,\u201d she says. \u201cI think the riding really gave me the ability to focus under pressure, think fast and react according to changing situations.\u201d\n\nShe adds: \u201cI\u2019m definitely competitive, but having said that, I think you have to learn how to lose to really understand the winning part.\u201d\n\nThat understanding helped fuel Lisa\u2019s determination as well.\n\n\u201cI get the biggest reward from being a problem-solver and bringing really tough deals together. If there is a solution to be found, I won\u2019t sleep until I figure it out.\u201d\n\nAnd on her days off?\n\n\u201cHa! I don\u2019t have many of those!\u201d she laughs. \u201cIf the world ever gets to a new normal, I\u2019d love to travel more. Expanding my repertoire in the kitchen would be great too. And growing up, we did a lot of boating as a family, so being out on the water will always be something I love.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Boulevard Interview with Blaise MacDonald\n\nThe 7 Sins\n\nEnvy:\n\nWhose shoes would you like to walk in?\n\nI have to say that I\u2019m pretty happy walking in mine most of the time (hats off to John Fluevog for great style and amazingly comfortable shoes), but I\u2019d love to have walked in Steve Nash\u2019s shoes during his NBA run. I think Steve is the epitome of hard work and focus equalling success. In a world of brash big talkers, Steve moved faster, thought smarter and delivered with grace and style. What an amazing ambassador for Canada!\n\nGluttony:\n\nWhat is the food you could eat over and over again?\n\nI\u2019m addicted to the Prawn Phad Thai from Ba\u2019an Thai Wok & Bar. It\u2019s amazing! Also pretzels\u2014ridiculous\u2014but they have to have just the right amount of salt.\n\nGreed:\n\nYou\u2019re given $1 million that you have to spend selfishly. What would you spend it on?\n\nPre-COVID-19, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to say world travel and enjoying new culinary experiences. Now, I think it would be having a sunny little getaway place on one of the Gulf Islands to share with family and friends\u2014and a faster boat to come and go!\n\nWrath:\n\nPet peeves?\n\nConceit, laziness and, the worst, entitlement.\n\nSloth:\n\nWhere would you spend a long time doing nothing?\n\nI don\u2019t like to sit still for very long, but I\u2019m quite happy doing nothing on the beach at Sidney Spit, or up in Desolation Sound, provided \u201cnothing\u201d includes some wine, fresh prawns or crab on the portable barbecue, and some good music and friends to share it with!\n\nPride:\n\nWhat is the one thing you\u2019re secretly proud of?\n\nOn the play side, I\u2019ve been lucky to have been able to compete and win at some top-level Hunter Jumper competitions in New York, DC, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and California. It\u2019s a special partnership with the right horse, and a pretty incredible feeling to win under pressure. With real estate, I\u2019m proud to be the highest-selling agent in Victoria and will be the first to reach the billion-dollar milestone in overall sales this year. I\u2019m grateful to be able to do what I love, and lucky to live in such a special place in the world! Since COVID, I know I definitely appreciate it more than ever.\n\nLust:\n\nWhat makes your heart beat faster?\n\nSpeed. Winning. Making the deal happen and calling the clients to tell them. Music, dancing, great food and wine, laughing so hard it hurts. And of course, being in love!\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nLifestyle",
