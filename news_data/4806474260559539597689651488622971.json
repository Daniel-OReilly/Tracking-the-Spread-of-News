(Hulu via AP)\n\nIn the first days of Greta Thunberg\u2019s solitary sidewalk protest outside Swedish Parliament in August 2018, most walk right past her. Some pause and ask why she\u2019s not in school. But people steadily begin to take notice of the steadfast 16-year-old girl.\n\nThose humble beginnings of Thunberg\u2019s protest \u2014 the unlikely birth of a global movement \u2014 are seen in the opening minutes of the new documentary \u201cI Am Greta.\u201d Since then, Thunberg has met world leaders, been vilified by others, and seen countless join her in an ever-growing resistance to environmental complacency. It\u2019s a journey she readily describes as totally surreal \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s like living in a movie and you don\u2019t know the plot,\u201d she says \u2014 but also affirming.\n\n\u201cI look back and I remember how it felt. I think: Oh, I was so young and naive back then \u2014 which is quite funny,\u201d says Thunberg, recalling her first days of protest in an interview. \u201cSo much has changed for me since then but also so much hasn\u2019t changed from the bigger perspective.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like now I\u2019m happier in my life,\u201d she adds. \u201cWhen you do something that\u2019s meaningful, it gives you the feeling that you\u2019re meaningful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI Am Greta,\u201d which debuts Friday on Hulu, is the first documentary to chart the meteoric rise of Thunberg from an anonymous, uncertain teen to an international activist. As an intimate chronicle of a singular figure, it plays like a coming-of-age story for someone who seemed, from the start, uncannily of age. The film, directed by Nathan Grossman, captures the head-spinning accomplishments, and the toll they sometimes take, on the bluntly impassioned Thunberg.\n\nFor an activist who insists on putting the cause before herself, it\u2019s also a somewhat uncomfortable acceptance of the spotlight. \u201cI haven\u2019t really achieved anything,\u201d Thunberg says, speaking by phone from Sweden. \u201cEverything the movement has achieved.\u201d\n\nShe doesn\u2019t endorse everything about the documentary. It should come as no surprise that Thunberg, who has called her Asperger\u2019s syndrome her \u201csuperpower\u201d \u2014 a condition she believes only enhances her ability to be straightforward and focused \u2014 has a few notes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really like the title of the film, \u2018I Am Greta.\u2019 It makes it seem like I take myself very seriously,\u201d says Thunberg. (In Sweden, the film is simply called \u201cGreta,\u201d but that title was recently taken by the 2018 Isabelle Huppert film.) \u201cAlso the poster. I look like I have make-up on. I don\u2019t like the poster and the title.\u201d\n\nGrossman began filming Thunberg soon after she began protesting in August 2018, but he didn\u2019t expect much from it. He told Thunberg he might not stick around for more than a few hours. He shot in half-resolution to save memory cards.\n\nBut as time went on, and young people around the world began following Thunberg\u2019s lead, Grossman realized he had unwittingly captured the first moments of an unfolding zeitgeist. The project evolved and Grossman continued to shadow Thunberg up to her scorching speech at the United Nations in which she admonished world leaders: \u201cWe are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe felt that a movie about her could help clarify things,\u201d says Grossman. \u201cIn the media, I think, she hasn\u2019t felt that she recognized herself. The one-dimensional character of Greta is a very angry, frustrated girl. In the movie, you see so much more \u2014 that she\u2019s also funny and has different sides.\u201d\n\nPart of the power of Thunberg is that, as a 17-year-old, she literally embodies a future imperiled by the inaction of older generations. \u201cI Am Greta\u201d is in a way a profile of generational divide, where adults and politicians line up to take selfies with a young woman who despite her stature sometimes struggles to get out of bed for an appointment or cries for home while sailing across the Atlantic.\n\nBut if Thunberg, Time magazine\u2019s Person of the Year in 2019, is recognizably human in \u201cI Am Greta,\u201d she\u2019s also ruthlessly frank. She doesn\u2019t mince words on Earth\u2019s trajectory. She dismisses superficial gestures for change. And she shrugs off those who dismiss or mock her message. Asked how she felt watching news clips of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin deriding her in the film, Thunberg laughs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the highlights! It\u2019s hysterically funny,\u201d Thunberg says. \u201cIt just proves that you\u2019re doing something right. If you\u2019re being attacked by these kinds of people that shows you\u2019re doing something right. It just shows how desperate they are not to talk about the climate.\u201d\n\nDuring the pandemic, Thunberg has seen climate slip from front pages. But she wishes the climate could generate the same level of alarm that COVID-19 has. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re stuck no matter what we do,\u201d she says. \u201cWe won\u2019t achieve real change unless we actually start to treat the climate crisis like a crisis.\u201d\n\nIn September, Thunberg was again outside Swedish Parliament for a socially distanced climate protest, part of thousands of school strikes held that day. But watching the U.S. presidential debates, where climate was a little-discussed issue and summarily dismissed by Trump, she says, has been eye-opening.\n\n\u201cIt surprises me. I knew the situation in the U.S. was bad when it comes to climate, that it\u2019s being treated as an opinion rather than actual scientific fact, but I didn\u2019t know it was this bad,\u201d says Thunberg. \u201cEurope and Sweden, we are very, very far from where we need to be in the discussion. But compared to the U.S., it\u2019s just surprising.\u201d\n\nEarlier this fall, Thunberg returned to school after taking a year off.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve missed it a lot. It just feels very good to be back in school and to do normal things, to have routines. I love routines \u2014 that\u2019s probably a lot because of my autism,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd in this environment, I\u2019m almost anonymous in a way. People know who I am, of course, but I\u2019m not there because I\u2019m famous. I\u2019m there to do something else, I\u2019m just like the rest.\u201d\n\nAnonymity might no longer be a long-term option for Thunberg, who will turn 18 in January. But it\u2019s a tradeoff she will make. When she reflects on the last two years, she sounds dangerously close to being something few would label Thunberg: an optimist.\n\n\u201cBefore I started doing this, my experience was that no one cared. Now I\u2019ve been proven wrong. Obviously, many people, especially young people, care about the climate crisis and the future, and that\u2019s encouraging,\u201d says Thunberg. \u201cHumanity has not yet failed. We are failing, but humanity has not failed.\u201d\n\nJake Coyle, The Associated Press\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nWant to support local journalism?
