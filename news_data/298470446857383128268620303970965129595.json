We look forward to getting things going again in January with all of our players back on the ice.\u201d\n\nAlmost 50 per cent of the league is currently made up of players 19 or older, which means nearly half of the BCHL\u2019s players are currently ineligible to practice with their team under the order.\n\nThe BCHL has adhered to all travel restrictions imposed by the PHO and none of its players are traveling anywhere outside of their home arena. Despite that, the PHO has restricted 19 and 20-year-old players from practicing with their teams.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed that our 19 and 20-year-old players are not able to join their teammates in on-ice activities,\u201d said BCHL Commissioner Chris Hebb. \u201cWe are working diligently with BC Hockey, viaSPORT BC and the PHO to get our older players on the ice, but at the moment we must follow the PHO\u2019s order as written.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the current restrictions only directly affect athletes age 19 and up, there are unintended consequences for our younger players as well,\u201d said BCHL Executive Director Steven Cocker. \u201cAlthough they are still allowed on the ice, the fact remains that half of their teammates are not, which essentially means their teams and the league are forced to pause operations until restrictions are lifted.\u201d\n\nIf current restrictions are extended beyond midnight on Jan. 8, the league will come together and make a decision on when play can resume.\n\nThe BCHL consists of 18 teams throughout B.C., and one in Washington State. That team, the Wenatchee Wild, opted out of the whole season.",
