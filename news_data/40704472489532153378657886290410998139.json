His undeniable dedication and commitment to the sport and our youth players is infectious and motivating.\u201d\n\nEqually, Germain said, Mack did way more than what was expected of her.\n\nWhile ostensibly a behind-the-scenes person for the society, Mack was out every day making sure things were running properly under the regulations and got involved in many different ways.\n\n\u201cShe put her heart and soul into making sure we could get up and running this year,\u201d Germain explained. \u201cAnd she goes above and beyond by, even, she helped coach last year and things like that. She\u2019s just always there to help.\u201d\n\nThe BVSS is still active with its fall indoor program. The five-on-five format is being played in three different age groups. The under-eight and under-12 groups are playing at Walnut Park Elementary School. The under-12s also have games at Bulkley Valley Christian School where the under-14s, under-16s and under-18s are also playing.\n\nGermain said approximately 70 kids are participating across all the age groups.\n\n\n\neditor@interior-news.com\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter\n\n\n\nSign up here Get local stories you won't find anywhere else right to your inbox.\n\nGeorgia Mack with her two children XXX and YYY.
