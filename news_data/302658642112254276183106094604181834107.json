The box includes a step-by-step guide on how to enjoy the experience and includes access to recipes, guides, and a music play-list with a Hawaiian theme.\n\nSprake, who owns seven businesses, said he got the idea for the Staycation Boxes after talking to a travel agent.\n\nHe said the agent, who he was mentoring as part of his business coaching service, was at a loss due to the number of trip cancellations caused by the global pandemic. He said she was sending videos to clients of different vacation spots they could possibly go once the virus passed.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just bring the vacation to peoples homes?\u201d Sprake thought.\n\nSprake said the company has been an instant success, with an unexpected client base accounting for a majority of sales.\n\n\u201cEmployers want to say thank you to their employees, realtors, mortgage brokers want to say thank you to their clients when they buy a property or financial planners want to say thank you to their customers,\u201d Sprake said.\n\n\u201cIn the last month, I really started to look at it and go, \u2018We\u2019ve got two markets we need to focus on.\u201d\n\nHe said the boxes are designed to be gifts of gratitude, and they include a financial contribution to the food bank.\n\nHe said whenever someone orders a box, whether they reside in White Rock or Aurora, Ont., Staycation Box will send a percentage of the proceeds to the food bank that serves the recipient\u2019s hometown.\n\n\u201cOnce these boxes are done, once a month we sit down and write cheques to all the different food banks, and we ship them out across the country.\u201d\n\nFor his own part, Sprake says his family strives to collect 5,000 pieces of food and make a $5,000 donation to the South Surrey White Rock Food Bank ever year.\n\nTo learn more about Staycation Boxes, visit staycationboxes.com\n\n\n\naaron.hinks@peacearchnews.com\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter\n\nCoronavirusLocal Businesstravel",
