Among the most impacted groups is one of our most vulnerable \u2013 seniors. Some of them have not been able to see their loved ones for months, and with that isolation comes heartbreak, despair, or worse.\n\nThe Interior News extends a call to action. We would like to dedicate editorial space in upcoming issues at least until New Year\u2019s Eve to personal messages or photos from family to seniors who are in isolation.\n\nMessages should be no more than 50 words and can be addressed to a specific person or people, or be general sentiments.\n\nPhotos should be in jpeg or tif format and accompanied by a description, including names of people in the photo and the name(s) of the person or people for whom it is intended.\n\nSubmit your messages and photos of love and care to editor@interior-news.com.\n\nThis holiday season especially, we want to ensure no one is forgotten. Please join us!\n\n\u2013 Thom Barker, Editor, The Interior News\n\n\n\neditor@interior-news.com\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter\n\nAgassizHarrison Hot Springs",
