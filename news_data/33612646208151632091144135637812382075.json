Feeny said she will return to the property to rescue the remaining 13 cats at a later date.\n\nKimberly Feeny, left, rescues, fosters and homes cats with the Kootenay Animal Assistance Program.

The rescues are recovering from eye infections Feeny said are common among outdoor cats who live in a large colonies.\n\nHer friend Lisa Valenta was busy administering the cats\u2019 eye drops when The Grand Forks Gazette turned up Friday afternoon. Feeny had just arrived from picking up cat food and kitty litter donated by city residents. The pair hopes to nurse the cats to the point where they are well enough to be neutered, spayed and micro-chipped by a local veterinarian.\n\nThe cats are being sheltered in a heated trailer outside Feeny\u2019s home. This cat was kept in a carrying crate while he waited for his eye drops from Feeny\u2019s friend, Lisa Valenta.
