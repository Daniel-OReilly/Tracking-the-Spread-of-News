(THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chad Hipolito)\n\nDear parents,\n\nB.C.\u2019s teachers care deeply about our students, your children.\n\nWe are all working incredibly hard to make sure they are safe and receiving the best education possible during this terrible pandemic.\n\nNothing about this school year has been easy and all of us are feeling stress and anxiety. We\u2019re worried about COVID-19 affecting our students, our families and ourselves. Making sure our schools and classrooms are safe for our children and yours has been the top priority for us all.\n\nNow, as B.C. is gripped by this surging second wave of the coronavirus, we\u2019re reaching out to you for some help.\n\n#BCed teachers are committed to providing our students with supportive and enriching learning environments. We also need them to be safe. Please help make that happen. We encourage you to talk to your children and encourage them to wear masks. #bcpoli \u2014 BCTF (@bctf) November 24, 2020\n\nWhile masks are not mandatory at all times in schools, we\u2019re hoping you can help us support a culture of mask wearing. Some schools have already taken this step. The school community has come together and made mask wearing normal and expected. It really helps everyone in our schools feel safer. We need to be doing all we can to ensure we keep each other safe. No one wants to bring COVID-19 home to their families.\n\nWe know there are students and staff members who for various reasons can\u2019t wear masks. And, there are some learning situations where masks aren\u2019t appropriate. That\u2019s all OK. Our school communities have a lot of experience making sure people are included and treated with kindness and respect.\n\nBy talking to your children about wearing their masks in school, you can help us create that respectful culture of mask wearing.\n\nRead more: B.C. teachers\u2019 union calls on Horgan to limit Fraser Health class sizes to 15 students\n\nRead more: B.C. labour board to provide neutral \u2018troubleshooters\u2019 for COVID-19 school plans\n\nBCTF members, your children\u2019s teachers, are committed to providing our students with supportive and enriching learning environments. We also need them to be safe. Please help make that happen. We encourage you to talk to your children and encourage them to wear masks.\n\nTeri Mooring,\n\nPresident,\n\nBC Teachers\u2019 Federation\n\nBritish ColumbiaSchools",
