The Toronto Raptors say three members of the organization have tested positive for COVID-19. THE CANADIAN PRESS/ Cole Burston\n\nThe Toronto Raptors say three members of the organization have tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nThe Raptors didn\u2019t disclose who received the positive tests, or whether or not they were players. The news comes five days before the Raptors are scheduled to tip off their three-game pre-season schedule.\n\nA day earlier, coach Nick Nurse had talked about how potentially devastating COVID-19 could be to the team and the season.\n\n\u201cMy role is to just constantly be on (players) and be a reminder constantly of our actions and our behaviour, and how impactful it is not only themselves, their families, our team, the organization, there\u2019s lots on the line if you\u2019re not doing the best you can with the COVID-19 protocols,\u201d Nurse said.\n\nThe team said in a release that the positive results came during the NBA-mandated testing period prior to training camp. The league announced last week that 48 players \u2014 about nine per cent \u2014 had tested positive in pre-camp testing.\n\nOn Sunday, the Portland Trail Blazers shut down their practice facility due to three positive cases within their organization.\n\nThe Raptors said the three individuals are self-isolating away from the rest of the team.\n\nThe Raptors opened training camp last week at their temporary home of Tampa, Fla., with Sunday marking the first day they could train together as a team. They\u2019re playing their \u201chome\u201d games, for at part of the season, at Tampa\u2019s Amalie Arena due to Canada\u2019s travel regulations around the global pandemic.\n\nThey are scheduled to play their first pre-season game Saturday at Charlotte and open the 2020-21 season Dec. 23 against the visiting New Orleans Pelicans.\n\nREAD MORE: Raptors\u2019 unique trait is \u2018togetherness,\u2019 Ujiri says Toronto will adapt to Tampa\n\nLori Ewing, The Canadian Press\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nWant to support local journalism during the pandemic?
