In light of those savings, prize organizers are donating $25,000 each to the Indigenous Voices Awards and Diaspora Dialogues, an initiative to support diverse writers.\n\nThe event will air on CBC and its Gem streaming service at 9 p.m. tonight.\n\nThe finalists were chosen by jury members Mark Sakamoto, Eden Robinson, David Chariandy, Tom Rachman, and Claire Armitstead.\n\nThe long list of 14 titles announced in September had some big names who didn\u2019t make the cut, including Thomas King, Emma Donoghue, and Lynn Coady.\n\nA total of 118 works were submitted for this year\u2019s prize, according to organizers.\n\nFounded in 1994, the Giller awards $100,000 annually to the author of the best Canadian novel, graphic novel or short story collection published in English, and $10,000 to each of the finalists.\n\nAdina Bresge, The Canadian Press\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nWant to support local journalism?
