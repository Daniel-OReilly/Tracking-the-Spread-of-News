(Photo: K-J MIllar/The Northern View)\n\nThe Prince Rupert Salvation Army is struggling to meet its annual Christmas Kettle Campaign goals, with just less than half of the goal reached and only two weeks to go until Christmas, Dawn Butt S.A. Lieutenant told The Northern View on Dec. 9th.\n\nThe goal this year was to raise $30,000 from kettle donations, however, with COVID-19 restrictions, there are just two public Christmas kettles in town. Kettles are located at Walmart and BC Liquor Store, with a third available for clientele inside the Moose Lodge. Kettles are out for donations until Dec. 24.\n\n\u201cOur kettles are not doing so well,\u201d Butt said. \u201c\u2026 our kettle numbers are actually down this year.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have our online kettle as well, where people can donate, so that is helping a little bit with our kettles, but we are probably not even at the halfway mark for where we wanted to be. It is kind of sad. \u201c\n\nIt is unknown if the donation predicament is due to COVID-19, or with people playing it safe and donating in other ways. However, there are volunteers aplenty which is great with most kettle volunteer spots already filled, the pastor said.\n\n\u201cWe are getting lots of volunteers, I think we have only three more spots to fill, so that is great.\u201d\n\nWhile monetary gifts and donations are down and causing concerns, food and toy drives are performing well.\n\n\u201cOur food drives have done really well. Our toy drives have gone really well,\u201d Butt said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had great partnerships with (community businesses) who have participated.\u201d\n\nMore to come in The Northern View print edition\n\nK-J Millar | Journalist\n\nemail\n\nLike the The Northern View on Facebook\n\nFollow us on Twitter Send K-JLike theonFollow us on\n\nK-J Millar | Journalist\n\nemail\n\nLike the The Northern View on Facebook\n\nFollow us on Twitter Send K-JLike theonFollow us on",
