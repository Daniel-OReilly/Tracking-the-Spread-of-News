Marvel Entertainment, the biggest comic book publisher in the world, hired the 34-year-old First Nations illustrator as one of the artists involved in Marvel Voice: Indigenous Voices #1 in August. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jason Franson\n\nIndigenous illustrator Kyle Charles says hundreds of people have reached out to congratulate and thank him for his creations in a new Marvel anthology that tells the story of an Aboriginal mutant.\n\nMarvel Entertainment, the biggest comic book publisher in the world, hired the 34-year-old from Edmonton to be one of the artists for Marvel Voice: Indigenous Voices #1.\n\nSince its launch last week, people from around the world, including many Indigenous youth, have contacted him about how much they appreciate the content he has brought to a mainstream platform, Charles says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve even had young people reach out for advice,\u201d Charles, surrounded by Marvel memorabilia and old comics, says in an interview in his home studio northwest of the city.\n\n\u201cThey tell me they\u2019re working to get sober and \u2026 I just tell them, \u2018Hey, like, we all deal with the same thing, so I want you to just trust yourself and know your own past and remain strong in that pursuit.\u2019\u201d\n\nNeeding to remain strong is something the member of the Whitefish Lake First Nation understands well. He had a difficult childhood, got caught up with the wrong crowd in his late teens, and spent almost a decade homeless.\n\nThe lessons he has learned help him understand the struggles Indigenous youth go through. He hopes the Aboriginal characters in the anthology will help create an understanding that anyone can be a hero despite human flaws.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for anybody living in Canada or the U.S. to have proper cultural representation. For a long time, native people didn\u2019t have that, because they\u2019re not in any kind of spotlight or on any kind of platform. They\u2019re just in the background. I think something like this pushes us forward.\u201d\n\nCharles illustrates a story in the anthology featuring Dani Moonstar, who possesses the psychic ability to telepathically create illusions of her opponents\u2019 fears or wishes.\n\nMoonstar of the Cheyenne Nation \u201cfaces the crucial question of what her Indigenous heritage means in the new era of mutant-kind,\u201d says Marvel\u2019s official description.\n\nCharles says the strong and resilient Indigenous women in his life, including his girlfriend, his mother, and his \u2018\u201cCoco,\u201d or grandmother, remind him of Moonstar.\n\n\u201cMy Coco is dying of cancer right now but she\u2019s the strongest person I know,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cDoctors say she should be in palliative care, but they can\u2019t figure out why she has no pain \u2026 She should be struggling, and she\u2019s not. She\u2019s still going to dinner with my mom and showing up for bingo night,\u201d he laughs.\n\nThat\u2019s just how Indigenous women are \u2014 calm and capable of overcoming any obstacle \u2014 Charles says, and that\u2019s what he hopes young women reading the story and looking at his illustrations take away from Moonstar\u2019s tale.\n\n\u201cEntertainment and creative fields have that power to inspire people, to maybe change the way they think about themselves, or help them understand the world around them.\n\n\u201cI hope (women) get inspired or they feel empowered. I hope they get whatever they need out of it, even if it\u2019s just to escape.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing to me is (them) \u2026 seeing this and saying, \u2018That\u2019s me. I am that character.\u2019\u201d\n\n__\n\nThis story was produced with the financial assistance of the Facebook and Canadian Press News Fellowship.\n\nFakiha Baig, The Canadian Press\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nWant to support local journalism during the pandemic?
