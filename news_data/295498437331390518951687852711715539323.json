(Facebook Photo)\n\nThe question \u2018what if?\u2019 has haunted Garrett Kerr for more than two years now.\n\nHis brother, Cameron Kerr, 30, was killed in a hit and run in the early hours of Nov. 18, 2018 while walking home after drinking. Cameron was a sheet metal worker by trade, but he was also a former player for the Terrace River Kings hockey team and an avid outdoorsman who loved paddling, hunting and fishing. Everyone knew he was kind and compassionate and he had a tremendous sense of humour, Garrett says.\n\nThe driver of the vehicle has not been caught, despite a rigorous RCMP investigation that has turned up significant evidence and identified a group of suspects from the Lower Mainland who may have colluded to cover up the incident.\n\nGarrett and Cameron were together that night and when speaking to Garrett it\u2019s clear he has asked himself over and over what he could have done differently, as so many people do when they grieve such a loss \u2014 particularly when the investigation is incomplete, leaving the family with few answers.\n\nThe night Cameron was killed, the brothers had attended a wake for a friend who died young of an overdose. Friends and family had gathered for a bittersweet night of sharing memories, Garrett says, at a home in New Remo.\n\nWhen Cameron was ready to leave, he decided to walk home to Terrace along Hwy 16. It\u2019s a long walk, but not unfamiliar to the brothers, who grew up in New Remo. Before Cameron left, he had a conversation with Garrett in the driveway. Garrett tried to convince him to wait for a cab or to sleep at their parents\u2019 home in New Remo.\n\nBut Cameron wanted to walk, so Garrett let him go and returned to the party.\n\nAn oncoming vehicle struck Cameron shortly after he left as he walked against traffic on the shoulder of the highway, according to the RCMP. The driver and companions took hours to cover up the incident before continuing northwest along the highway, the Kerr family says.\n\nA while after Cameron left, Garrett and a group of friends piled into a cab and headed toward Terrace. There was an energetic mood in the cab, Garrett says, and nobody was paying attention to the ditch on the opposite side of the road.\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t know to this day whether my brother was alive when I rode by in the cab,\u201d Garrett says, his voice breaking, in a recent interview with The Terrace Standard. \u201cThe longer these guys hold out and don\u2019t co-operate, the longer I have to live with that.\u201d\n\nCameron\u2019s body was found in the ditch around noon by a member of the public.\n\nGarrett had been trying to reach Cameron that morning and had gone by Cameron\u2019s place to find he wasn\u2019t home. Then Garrett drove back out toward New Remo with a sinking feeling in his gut.\n\n\u201cI had made most of the drive out there wondering,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd sure enough I came around the next corner and there was a police stoppage and police tape.\u201d\n\nPolice quickly identified a suspect vehicle, a 2011-2016 Ford F350 pickup truck. Tips from the public lead police to discover an abandoned boat trailer associated with the case.\n\nThen on Nov. 21, just days after Cameron was killed, police announced they had identified a truck on Haida Gwaii with damage consistent with the collision and said they were confident they had identified a suspect driver who was from the Lower Mainland. They seized the suspect F350 truck, another truck and two boat trailers (in addition to the abandoned boat trailer discovered earlier). Police questioned seven people who may have been involved in the incident.\n\nThen, nothing. The RCMP didn\u2019t quite have enough evidence to recommend charges. Garrett and his family held a press conference on Dec. 19, one month after Cameron was killed, appealing for people to come forward with information.\n\nThey were joined by Sgt. Shawn McLaughlin, the primary RCMP member on the case.\n\n\u201cWe will not relent until we deliver the driver responsible [and he] is brought to justice,\u201d Sgt. McLaughlin said at the press conference. \u201cThe last thing I want to see is that those responsible, or those that are hiding evidence \u2026 enjoying their Christmas while forgetting the faces of those you see here today.\u201d\n\nRCMP conducted a search for evidence along Hwy 16 in April 2019, once weather conditions permitted, aided by members of Terrace and Prince Rupert Search and Rescue organizations. The search yielded several pertinent items, police said, though they did not disclose the nature of the items.\n\nSince then, the Kerr family has remained focused on asking the suspects, as well as the suspects\u2019 families and friends, to come forward with information. The Kerr family held another public appeal press conference (their third) in November 2019, about a year after Cameron was killed.\n\nAnd they paid for a letter to be published in Lower Mainland newspapers in April 2020, summarizing their understanding of the incident and pleading for associates of the suspects to come forward.\n\n\u201cTo the parents, wives, girlfriends and friends of a group of men from the Lower Mainland: In November 2018, these men set off for a fishing and hunting trip to Haida Gwaii,\u201d the letter begins.\n\n\u201cAfter passing through Terrace, they were involved in a tragic collision \u2026 after the collision, they spent hours hiding their damaged boat trailer in the woods \u2026 they transferred the boat to the new trailer and proceeded to Haida Gwaii as if nothing had happened. The persons responsible for his death knowingly left Cameron to die alone, not caring enough to call for help.\u201d\n\n\u201cTheir trucks, boats and trailers were all impounded by the police, so when they returned to the Lower Mainland, it was without those possessions \u2026 If you recognize these men by this story, the family of Cameron Kerr pleads with you to urge [the suspects] to do the right thing and go to the authorities so that this nightmare can end for Cameron\u2019s family, as well as these individuals.\u201d\n\nGarrett says the family does not blame the RCMP for the fact that the investigation has not been concluded and they are grateful for the work the RCMP have done.\n\nBut they still want justice.\n\n\u201cThere is a part of the grieving process that is not available to us while this is hanging over our heads,\u201d he says.\n\nSgt. McLaughlin, speaking to The Terrace Standard on Dec. 2, 2020, says he can\u2019t share many details of the current status of the investigation, but he says police are not sitting idly waiting for someone to come forward.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re at a dead end in that regard,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s possible other means that I can\u2019t get into that we might resort to.\u201d\n\nHe says the RCMP are keeping the Kerr family in the loop as much as possible.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s been a strong goal of ours is to make sure that we\u2019re engaged with the family because we do realize it\u2019s been two years and they want that assurance and they deserve that assurance to know that this hasn\u2019t fallen off our plate,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are still continuing to investigate and use various means to do so.\u201d\n\nSgt. McLaughlin added that the investigation has shown police that Cameron was very well respected in his community.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very important file to the community and it\u2019s a very important file to our membership here,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really close to our hearts and we\u2019re working on it the best we can every day.\u201d\n\nThe River Kings held tributes to Cameron at home games in 2018 and 2019 and the community showed up in force to both games. Each year, the Terrace Pipes and Drums Society performed at the games in commemoration of Cameron\u2019s Scottish heritage. The team likely would have held a tribute again this year but the league cancelled its season due to the pandemic.\n\nSteve Cullis, captain of the River Kings, is a friend of Garrett and Cameron\u2019s. He was with the brothers at the wake the night Cameron was killed.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty tough news,\u201d he says. \u201cI want some closure for the family more than anything. How long do they have to keep guessing as to what exactly happened?\u201d\n\nGarrett says the grief of losing his brother comes in waves.\n\n\u201cThe first couple of months it\u2019s just like nothing you could have ever imagined. Then you sort of get to where you just have to be able to function in your life,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are times when I\u2019m just angry \u2026 I don\u2019t know. You just aren\u2019t ever going to be the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the same time, I don\u2019t think Cameron would have wanted us all to be in that sort of head space forever either.\u201d\n\nIn November of this year, near the anniversary of Cameron\u2019s death, a small group of family and friends went to the spot where his body was found to visit a memorial. It\u2019s made of antlers, to repesent his love of hunting, his fishing rod, and kayaking oars to represent his love of paddling.\n\nCameron would have wanted those who love him to come together to support each other in grief, Garrett says, so they have strived to do that, even though it\u2019s been challenging during the pandemic. And Cameron would have wanted them to laugh together.\n\n\u201cHe was one of the funniest people you\u2019d ever know,\u201d Garrett says.\n\nGarrett has so many wonderful memories of his brother from over the years, and often it\u2019s the more recent happy memories that come to his mind. He recalls time they spent running together, and laughs as he admits Cameron was the better runner.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d spend a bit of time training for the King of the Mountain [foot race] or just running for the heck of it,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I want to really remember him, I try to go run around Terrace Mountain and feel like I\u2019m getting my ass kicked, because I certainly felt that way when I was running with him.\u201d\n\nGarrett is thankful to the Terrace area community for its support.\n\n\u201cEverybody up here thinks about Cameron all the time and they\u2019ve been so helpful in the investigation,\u201d he says. \u201cBut really the people that can make a difference at this point are living their lives down south.\u201d\n\n\u2013 With files from Natalia Balcerzak\n\nPolice are asking anyone with information and who has not already spoken with police to call Sgt. Shawn McLaughlin with West Pacific Region Traffic Services at 250-638-7438 or, if you wish to remain anonymous, call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477 (TIPS).",
