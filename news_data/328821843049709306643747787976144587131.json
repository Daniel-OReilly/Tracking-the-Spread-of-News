(Aaron Guillen/News Staff)\n\nPaul Larouche has been hunting for treasures since he was young, but now the Sooke man has hit the mother lode.\n\nWith more than 215,000 subscribers on YouTube, the 29-year-old spends his time creating content around finding gold, gems and odd treasures from his travels under the name PioneerPauly.\n\nYou won\u2019t find many videos where he isn\u2019t wearing his signature red and white toque with Canada written across the front.\n\nHe\u2019s found an old pickaxe, Spanish coins, jewelry and obsidian arrowheads during his travels across the province and into several American states. He\u2019s even visited Australia for gold.\n\nBut all the treasures in the world couldn\u2019t convince him to get out of bed four years ago.\n\nAt the age of 25, he was living a different life. He was working as a security worker after leaving the film and TV production industry. As someone who struggles with anxiety and depression, he felt like he was hitting a wall.\n\nREAD MORE: Gold panning means getting back to the land\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t doing much with my life,\u201d Larouche said. \u201cI was at a point where I just felt so lost and completely stuck. I was staying inside and didn\u2019t want to leave the house.\u201d\n\nThat is until his uncle, who lives in Langford, tried to get him outside and unearthed a passion for gold panning.\n\nThe 29-year-old remembers that day he first went out with his uncle back in 2017.\n\n\u201cIt felt so strange just digging in the mud I thought I was wasting my time,\u201d Larouche said. \u201cThe first time I washed out my pan, I saw something so bright and shiny. It was surreal when I found my first speck of gold. I was almost speechless. I didn\u2019t know that this stuff still existed out here.\u201d\n\nSince then, he\u2019s dedicated his time to be an expert at the hobby-turned-career.\n\nHe scoops a mound of dirt into a gold pan at the water\u2019s edge along Sooke River, where he bought a gold claim. He pointed out that because gold is heavy, the metal will drop to the pan\u2019s bottom. He always looks for low-pressure spots along the river whenever he goes out.\n\nHe brought a metal detector to use on land and a diving suit to gold snipe, where he uses a mask and snorkel to find pieces of gold in the water.\n\nALSO READ: The golden rule of Goldstream: there is no gold\n\nNot too far down the same river is where he found one of the biggest pieces he owns, clocking in at 7.5 grams. In one instance, he found 13 grams tucked into a crevice of bedrock underwater. He assumes a gold miner visited decades ago but couldn\u2019t continue looking into that spot, as he also found a broken pickaxe nearby.\n\nLooking to the future, Larouche dreams of one day pitching a documentary-style show to a major broadcasting company or a streaming service, like Netflix.\n\nHe\u2019s hosted several celebrities on his channel, including DALLMYD, an adventure YouTuber with more than 11 million subscribers and Michael Einziger, co-founder and lead guitarist for the American rock band INCUBUS.\n\nHe\u2019s planning to travel to Alaska when the borders reopen, and he\u2019s got his eyes set on Africa as well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping to convince him to go up north into Nunavut and the Arctic Circle soon,\u201d said Jeremy Woolsey, his second cousin who lives in Ladysmith and grew up gold panning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about timing, though, because we don\u2019t want all the ice to freeze over. We can pan in one of the glacier creeks, and it would be a first for both of us. Since they\u2019ve got long days and nights up there, I\u2019d rather go up when we can get the most sunlight.\u201d\n\nUntil then, Larouche doesn\u2019t mind filling his days with dreams of buried treasure, just waiting to be unearthed.\n\nRELATED: Shifting the lens on Sooke\u2019s gold rush\n\nDo you have a story tip?
