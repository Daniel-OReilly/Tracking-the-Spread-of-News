Their medical professionals are embedded in the project to provide their workforce with on-site care.\n\nBy engaging the medical expertise of International SOS, Coastal GasLink is also delivering on a key commitment to minimize the strain of project activities on local health care infrastructure.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to try to mitigate the impact that [any medical situation] would have on the local health care infrastructure by trying to manage them in the field,\u201d said Dr. Michael Evans, International SOS Canada\u2019s Medical Director.\n\n\u201cAs well as emergency services, we also provide a bridging primary care service to take care of a worker\u2019s basic medical needs, like ordering their prescription, so there\u2019s no need for them to go to town to see a physician or a nurse practitioner,\u201d adds Dr. Evans.\n\nDr. Evans and his team are also advising Coastal GasLink as they adapt their high standards for health and safety to meet all government guidelines and do their part to help slow the spread of COVID-19.\n\nTransmission prevention efforts are in effect project-wide with enhanced health screening for all workers.\n\nThat wealth of expertise and commitment to health and safety is also shared by International SOS medical professionals on the ground.\n\n\u201cWe are constantly adapting to execute our plans and it\u2019s been very successful,\u201d said Clint Papineau, a Registered Nurse with International SOS who is supporting Coastal GasLink in the Prince George area.\n\nPapineau and his colleagues carry out the protocols they\u2019ve implemented with International SOS. These include educating workers about health guidelines, enhanced screening of workers for symptoms, medical monitoring, and designated quarantine and evacuation protocols.\n\n\u201cThese parameters are in place so we can catch something early enough that the employee will be able to isolate themselves,\u201d said Papineau. \u201cMy colleagues are front line workers and we take this very seriously. This is part of Canada\u2019s economy and many thousands of people\u2019s livelihoods.\u201d\n\nInternational SOS and Coastal GasLink continue to work closely with health authorities, including Northern Health and WorkSafeBC, to ensure they are meeting all health directives and requirements.\n\nLearn more about the Coastal GasLink\u2019s commitment to health and safety at www.CoastalGasLink.com/Safety\n\nenergy sector",
