    "content": "Traffic controllers Hayley Stevens (left) and Hector Blackwater (right) have been recognized by drivers for their friendly waves, smiles and dance moves while working south of Terrace. (Ben Bogstie/Terrace Standard)\n\nA pair of exuberant traffic flaggers are drawing attention on Terrace social media.\n\n\u201cThey absolutely make my day every time I drive by them,\u201d commented Katherine Rezanson on the Terrace Community Bulletin Facebook page.\n\n\u201cNothing but respect for those two. I\u2019d never be able to handle that job and rain or shine they show up and stay happy and positive all day. I don\u2019t think they know how tough they really are. I hope their boss knows how good they are and takes care of them,\u201d Brian Kendel commented.\n\nColin Chase McKay added \u201cbest flaggers ever! One would hope to achieve that level of character on their job-site.\u201d\n\nThose are just a few of the many positive online comments from people driving past traffic controllers Hector Blackwater and Hayley Stevens at the Gruchy\u2019s Beach turn off south of Terrace.\n\nThe couple\u2019s waves, smiles and dance moves have not gone unnoticed by drivers.\n\n\u201cI started waving at people just as one of the rules that we learned at the [two-day traffic control personnel] course is to be kind and courteous and respectful and I thought just acknowledging people, like \u2018hey you got through the work zone safe, I see that you are there, you are doing the correct thing, good job,\u2019 so I thought about doing that and people drive past you and they feel comfortable,\u201d said Hayley, who is 23 years-old.\n\n\u201cI just like seeing all the individuality because everybody is so different out there, you get to see a little bit of their personality as they are going by,\u201d said Hector, 27.\n\nHector is from Gitaxt\u2019aamiks in the Nass Valley. He started flagging in high school when he needed an after-school job with flexible hours. Around that time he met Hayley on Facebook, who is from Kitselas. Now they live together in Gitaus and work for Gitxsan Safety Services.\n\nHayley is newer to the job. She said that the past few months have made her happy because she\u2019s had the ability to make people smile and make connections with drivers, many of whom pass by daily or weekly and drop off coffee or food.\n\n\u201cOne day I got like four coffees, I was so wired on caffeine,\u201d Hayley said with a laugh.\n\n\u201cSomeone saw me shivering and they put a jacket out their window and gave that to me, it was raining and I forgot my gear, yeah they\u2019ve been really nice and whenever people do give you coffees and neck warmers, whatever they feel like giving they\u2019ll say \u2018you really make our day, we love how you smile at us, it really brightens up our day when we are going by,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nHector describes himself as a go-getter \u2014 he likes to \u201cget it done\u201d and stay busy. Hayley said she is more easygoing but likes to persevere through things and work hard.\n\nSometimes shifts can be 14 hours-long in bad weather conditions, but Hector said that he sees staying positive as just a part of the job. He also pointed to the income gap between non-Indigenous and Indigenous people.\n\n\u201cEverybody is asking why I\u2019m so happy and all that. [It\u2019s] because I\u2019m Native and I\u2019m employed,\u201d Hector said. \u201cThrough this job I\u2019m finally able to save up to be poor, I\u2019m finally poor.\u201d\n\nIndigenous Canadians\u2019 median income is around 30 per cent less than the median income of non-Indigenous Canadians according to Statistics Canada.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never really seen that much money growing up, where I worked, I wouldn\u2019t make that much,\u201d Hayley said.\n\n\u201cBut with flagging the harder you are willing to work the more money you are able to make, the more you are able to say \u2018I can do this job, I\u2019m ready, you can depend on me,\u2019 you make some pretty decent money, you can live happier.\u201d\n\nThe couple is saving up for college and to eventually buy a house.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing at this job is we are going to make money, save it up, get established ourselves and go to school,\u201d Hayley said.\n\nHector is in his first year of the criminology program at Coast Mountain College and plans on becoming a lawyer.\n\n\u201cMy favourite class out of there that I would recommend everybody to take just for the hell of it really would be \u2018Women in Crime\u2019. It changed my perspective on women and in the workplace women are just treated so badly,\u201d Hector said.\n\n\u201cWomen, they do commit the same crimes but just they do it for different reasons, like mainly for self preservation like they feel threatened so they are going to protect themselves and if they are criminals it\u2019s more likely for profit.\u201d\n\nHayley has her sights set on psychology after taking a few college courses.\n\n\u201cI did really well in the psychology course and that helped me learn emotional control, how to stay positive, managing yourself better and I think that honestly if I did not go do that course I would not be able to be so happy as I am at my job,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI believe in it, I believe it can help people, I think it\u2019s important, it\u2019s interesting.\u201d\n\nHector is also a mixed martial artist. He has trained in the sport for ten years and has a couple amateur fights under his belt. He is planning to return to the sport after getting surgery and taking a hiatus following his longtime trainer Tony Rutledge\u2019s disappearance in 2017, after the small fishing vessel he was in capsized in the Douglas Channel.\n\nHe has helped Hayley learn self-defense and the couple does some training together, but Hayley said she doesn\u2019t see competitive fighting in her future.\n\n\u201cYou have to sign a death waiver so no I\u2019m not willing to sign that, he\u2019s the brave one,\u201d she said.\n\nThe couple\u2019s last day working by Gruchy\u2019s Beach was November 18, and now the job is shifting to avalanche control and flagging at automobile accidents during the winter. Both Hayley and Hector said that their work crew played a big part in keeping them positive over the past few months.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re one of the best, I\u2019m not going to say the best because that would probably make other people feel bad but they are one of the best crews I\u2019ve ever worked with, they are super hardworking and the unity of it was beautiful to see, it was like clockwork,\u201d Hector said.\n\nHayley said that friendly drivers made a difference too.\n\n\u201cIt makes me feel happy knowing that I help in some way in making somebody else smile, that\u2019s always a nice thing to do for somebody,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut I also let them know that \u2018hey you guys make me feel happy too\u2019 because a lot of people will do their best to be funny and make you giggle and that makes it so much easier to stay positive.\u201d\n\n@BenBogstie\n\nben.bogstie@terracestandard.com\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.",
