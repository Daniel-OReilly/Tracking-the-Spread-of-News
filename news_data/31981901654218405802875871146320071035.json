Neil recently welcomed Jessica Meadows to the Four Corners Team.\n\nThere\u2019s a shop on 4th Avenue just off Main St. that\u2019s been a barbershop since the late 1960s. Over the decades the shop has seen a few close shaves and wild styles, and this year it was time for a fresh cut.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked at this location for 19 years, and bought the business from my friend Klaus Mueller in December 2019,\u201d says Neil Worsfold, owner of Four Corners Barbershop. \u201cI\u2019ve been alone in here for the last few years, but now I\u2019m happy to welcome Jessica Meadows to the team.\u201d\n\nMeadows is new to Smithers but no stranger to hair \u2014 she\u2019s been a licensed barber for 15 years, and has been cutting men\u2019s and women\u2019s hair for 20.\n\n\u201cMy mother\u2019s a barber \u2014 she taught me how to do it. I did my first haircut when I was 12, and cut my friends\u2019 hair all through high school. I went to Hairdressing School right after,\u201d she says.\n\nBringing Meadows to Four Corners has meant that the barbershop is able to offer convenient hours again, Tuesday to Friday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nStop by for a chat, and a haircut\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a walk-in shop. That\u2019s always been a big plus \u2014 there\u2019s no worries about booking appointments,\u201d Worsfold says. \u201cWe like to have an atmosphere where people can have a nice time, feel free to chat and have some fun.\u201d\n\nWorsfold has enjoyed decorating the barbershop with sports memorabilia and local history to spark conversation. Local athletes like Dan Hamhuis and Jim Watson get prime placement, but nothing beats the signed Bobby Orr jersey.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the pride of my collection!\u201d Worsfold says. \u201cUFC, hockey, football, golf \u2014I\u2019m into all of it, and love chatting about it while I cut your hair. I\u2019m slowly adding some \u2018old time\u2019 Smithers things to the walls, like a realllllly old picture of music man Mark Perry.\u201d\n\nWith a wealth of personal history in Smithers as well, Worsfold was impressed to realize he\u2019s been a life-long barber to some of his clients, like Wyatt Grice.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just one of those kids \u2014he\u2019s super cool, sits in the chair as still as can be, and he\u2019s very engaging. For a young fella he holds a great conversation!\u201d\n\nMeadows also enjoys the conversational side of working at a barbershop.\n\n\u201cI love barbering so much! I get this half-hour window into people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nFour Corners Barbershop is a classic, no-appointment-necessary shop. Just walk-in to 3752 Fourth Ave. Tuesday to Saturday. Follow the shop on Facebook and Instagram for style inspiration, or give them a call at 250-877-7573.\n\nHairSmithers",
