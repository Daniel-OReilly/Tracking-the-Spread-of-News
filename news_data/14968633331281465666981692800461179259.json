(Lindsay Chung Photo)\n\nThe Central Interior Hockey League (CIHL) has cancelled its senior men\u2019s \u2018AA\u2019 2020/21 season, but league officials are keeping the door open to the possibility of exhibition games in the new year.\n\nThe league includes the Kitimat Ice Demons and teams in Prince Rupert, Terrace, Smithers, Hazelton, Williams Lake and Quesnel.\n\n\u201cWe had a schedule to start December 4th but with recent restrictions feel that in in any circumstances less than a super miracle vaccination, we would probably not return to play with spectators in time to salvage a 20-21 season,\u201d said Ron German, CIHL President, in a media release.\n\nGerman thanked the communities, fans, volunteers and sponsors for their support. He said that if conditions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic change in 2021, the league would explore the possibility of playing exhibition games if BC Hockey and local guidelines could be met.\n\n@BenBogstie\n\nben.bogstie@terracestandard.com\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.",
