My condolences to all who are mourning his passing today.\u201d\n\nSasakamoose, from Ahtahkakoop Cree Nation in Saskatchewan, played 11 games for the Chicago Blackhawks during the 1953-1954 season and, after bouncing around the minor leagues for a few seasons, landed with the Kamloops Chiefs in 1956.\n\nSasakamoose, who played in Kamloops until 1960, went on to become chief of his First Nation and served his community for decades.\n\n\u201cThank you for being a leader and paving the way for all of us Indigenous hockey players and helping us dream big,\u201d former Calgary Flames\u2019 star Theoren Fleury wrote on Twitter.\n\nSasakamoose worked for the last five decades to give Indigenous youth opportunities to participate in sports, helping establish the Northern Indian Hockey League, the Saskatchewan Indian Summer and Winter Games, Saskatoon\u2019s All Nations Hockey School and a hockey camp.\n\nHe was among 125 appointees to the Order of Canada in 2017.\n\nSolaine Sasakamoose, Fred\u2019s great-grand niece, played last season for the TRU WolfPack women\u2019s soccer team.
