    "content": "Investigation continues to determine cause of blast that injured three employees\n\nPinnacle Renewable Energy has re-opened its pellet plant in Houston, but on a reduced scale.\n\nAn explosion in the dryer area Nov. 25, which injured three employees, forced the closure until the damage could be assessed and dealt with and the company could reassure the provincial safety agency, WorkSafe BC, that steps had been taken to ensure worker safety.\n\nAlthough the plant re-opened, it is operating without its drying operations, said Pinnacle CEO chief operating officer Scott Bax.\n\n\u201cThe drying system repairs will take a few months to fully repair; we are working on more exact timing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are working on establishing the key contributing factors, working with third party experts to assist our internal investigation team,\u201d said Bax as Pinnacle assesses the reason for the incident, first described as a \u201cfire-related event.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not believe this to be a combustible dust-caused explosion. Our combustible dust safety measures were operating well at Houston,\u201d he added.\n\nTHE LATEST: Dr. Bonnie Henry denies \u2018constant condesencion\u2019 to faith community\n\n\u201cOur focus on continuous improvement in all aspects of mill safety mean that as we determine the key contributing factors, we will incorporate key findings to all other applicable operations.\u201d\n\nExternal experts brought in by the company include a fire investigation expert.\n\nWithout the dryer portion operating, the Houston plant is losing about 300-400 tonnes a day of pellet production.\n\nIt is producing using dry shavings only while some of the wet material is being shipped to Pinnacle\u2019s Burns Lake plant for the short term, Bax said.\n\n\u201cAll employees will continue to have full time employment supporting the plant\u2019s curtailed production and betterment work,\u201d said Bax.\n\nThe day of the explosion, Houston residents reported hearing a loud \u201cboom.\u201d The Houston Volunteer Fire Department responded to the explosion with two vehicles and spent several hours at the plant.\n\nMORE NEWS: Smithers Local Health Authority reports two COVID cases in first week of December\n\nPinnacle did contact WorkSafeBC immediately following the explosion and an inspection report indicated \u201csignificant equipment damage\u201d occurred.\n\n\u201cDismantling and repair of the damaged equipment will be conducted by contractors. Some of the work will require significant work at heights as well as confined space work,\u201d the report stated.\n\nPrior to re-opening, Pinnacle had to satisfy WorkSafeBC requirements, one being an inspection to identify the hazards created by the event and another being an approved plan to safely remove damaged components.\n\nWhile Pinnacle is the operator of the plant, which opened in 2006, it shares ownership with Canfor and the Witset First Nation. It has a rated annual capacity of 217,000 tonnes of industrial pellets and was the third such plant to be opened by Pinnacle.\n\n\n\neditor@interior-news.com\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter",
