(Photo: K-J Millar/The Northern View)\n\nBright red poppies are in abundance around Prince Rupert, with The Royal Canadian Legion\u2019s 2020 National Poppy Campaign officially launched and the local legion needing extra support due to COVID-19.\n\n\u201cWe just put out more than 10,000 poppies,\u201d Bernie Alexander poppy chairman and vice president of the Prince Rupert Legion Branch 127 told The Northern View. \u201cPoppy boxes have been placed in stores, restaurants, cafes, and places of business.\u201d\n\nMarie Lewis is the Prince Rupert Legion Branch President and said most years the poppy campaign results in between $7,000 to $10,000, but diminished contributions this year may hurt the local legion.\n\n\u201cWe hope to see that amount of money, but because of COVID-19, we don\u2019t have as many retailers participating this year. We are already anticipating a $3,000 to $4,000 reduction in donations,\u201d she said.\n\nRead more about The Royal Canadian Legion in the print version of The Northern View\n\nREAD MORE: \u2018Falling like dominoes\u2019: Pandemic could lead to closure of 10% of Canada\u2019s legions\n\nREAD MORE: Remembering Rupert: A historical report on Prince Rupert during the Second World War\n\nK-J Millar | Journalist\n\nemail\n\nLike the The Northern View on Facebook\n\nFollow us on Twitter Send K-JLike theonFollow us on\n\n\n\nSign up here Get local stories you won't find anywhere else right to your inbox.",
