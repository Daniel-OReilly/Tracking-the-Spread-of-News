Opening the scholarships up to the entire province is a way to find light in an otherwise dark situation.\n\n\u201cWe know this year has been very difficult,\u201d said Cliff Ronning, a former Vancouver Canucks who played for Quinn and now serves as honourary chair of the Pat Quinn Classic. \u201cWe also know many young hockey players have risen to the challenge by studying hard, being good teammates on the ice, and finding ways to take care of others in their community.\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s important that we reward these efforts and help them achieve their academic goals.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Canucks legend Pat Quinn dies at 71; \u2018We have lost a great man\u2019 says Linden\n\nThe Pat Quinn Classic is one of the longest running hockey tournaments in the world, though it has only existed in its current form since 2015.\n\nThe international tourney for bantams and peewees dates 58 years back to 1962, but it was renamed five years ago after the passing of legendary hockey coach Pat Quinn. Affectionately known by many as \u2018The Big Irishman,\u2019 Quinn died in November of 2014 at the age of 71, and the tournament was re-imagined as a way to carry forward his passion for developing great athletes and leaders.\n\n\u201c\u201dNot only have we created an exceptional tournament with terrific hockey, we have made leadership and academic success foundational to the tournament,\u201d Ronning said. \u201cPat would be proud that we are using this platform to inspire the next generation of leaders.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Chilliwack skaters lead Canucks to Earle Sinkie Trophy\n\nQuinn was a two-time winner of the Jack Adams Trophy as the National Hockey League coach of the year and was revered in Vancouver as the architect of the 1994 Stanley Cup finalist Canucks.\n\nHe spent 42 years of his life as an NHL player (1968-77), coach or general manager (1977-2010).\n\nInternationally, Quinn guided Team Canada to gold medals at the 2002 Winter Olympics, 2008 World U18 Championships and 2009 World Junior Championship. He added a World Cup title in 2004.\n\nQuinn was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2016 as a builder.\n\n\u201cI was fortunate to consider Pat a friend and mentor, and that\u2019s what fuels my passion and commitment to this tournament,\u201d Ronning said.\n\nThe Pat Quinn Classic is run in partnership with the Vancouver Canucks Alumni Association.\n\nTwo scholarships are sponsored by the Vancouver Canucks Alumni under the names of Quinn and Ronning, both members of the BC Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\nThe third scholarship is under the name of Kirk McLean and sponsored by Gary Pooni of Brook Pooni Associates. McLean is also a BC Hockey Hall of Famer and he is a member of the Canucks Ring of Honour.\n\nSix thousand dollars in scholarships have been awarded to six students over the past two years.\n\nThis year, male and female bantams have until Jan. 21 to apply at patquinnclassic.com/scholarshps/apply-now/\n\nhockeyScholarships",
