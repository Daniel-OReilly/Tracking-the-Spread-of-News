    "content": "Winter driving is stressful for everyone, and we all need to do our part to try and keep it safe\n\nWinter driving isn\u2019t easy. Everyone knows this.\n\nSnow piles up, tires slip around on the road, people drive a lot slower to be careful. The difference between summer and winter driving \u2014 especially in a region that gets to much snow \u2014 is noticeable, and it absolutely should be.\n\nWith the several days of snow we\u2019ve had in Kitimat over the past few weeks, I\u2019ve noticed many posts on Kitimat Facebook pages complaining about bad and dangerous drivers people have seen around town.\n\nPeople going through stop signs or red lights, making turns in the wrong lane, not using turn signals to turn or change lanes, speeding up to dangerous speeds to try to get in front of or around people while downtown or on major streets, to name a few. People forget that they can\u2019t drive in winter conditions the same way they drive in summer conditions; it just doesn\u2019t work that way if we want to be safe.\n\nOne post online I saw summed up some of the issues in quite a clever manner. It said: \u201cThe Lord moves in mysterious ways, but you don\u2019t have to. Please use your blinker.\u201d\n\nAnd honestly, it really is that simple. With winter driving, we need to drive like we\u2019re taking a driving test. Drive the speed limit, or often slower so you don\u2019t slip around on the roads and when turning. Use your blinkers to indicate every lane change and turn. Check your mirrors constantly to see who\u2019s around you. And mostly, just be kind to others on the road.\n\nEveryone gets stressed with winter driving, even those who have been driving for many, many years. New drivers, especially, need time to learn how to drive properly in winter weather, so try to pretend everyone you meet on the road is a newer driver.\n\nLet people in if there\u2019s a big line and they want to join your lane. Stay calm and patient when the person in front of you is taking their time trying to navigate a corner. And don\u2019t freak out at people if they slip or make a mistake. It\u2019s winter, mistakes are going to happen, but unless someone is killed or severely injured, it\u2019s usually not the end of the world.\n\nNow, that being said, I don\u2019t feel that you need to show kindness to those being jerks or being dangerous on the road. If you see someone driving dangerously or doing things that might not be safe for winter driving or might freak newer drivers out, report it. On Facebook, to the RCMP (depending on how dangerous it was, of course).\n\nPeople have the right to feel safe driving in their town and we need to stick together to make sure it stays that way, especially when the weather wants us to feel like we\u2019re driving on an ice rink.\n\n\u2018Driving Home For Christmas\u2019 by Chris Rea is one of my favourite Christmas songs and, yes, I know it\u2019s a bit too early for Christmas music for most people, but I find it works well to help calm me down when I get agitated or stressed when driving. It\u2019s got a nice, melodic rhythm and is calm, but just peppy enough to give you a nice, Christmasy driving feeling.\n\nAnd if that doesn\u2019t do it for you, I also find that screaming to yourself is a good way to get out your driving frustrations, without taking it out on anyone else on the road.\n\nSo stay safe this winter, drivers. Don\u2019t follow the Lord when it comes to moving in mysterious ways. Use your blinker.\n\n\u2014 Clare Rayment, Kitimat Northern Sentinel editor",
