    "content": "These days, Jens Pillat favours a simple life.\n\nThe 46-year-old used to be a firefighter in Germany before coming to B.C. to earn his helicopter pilot\u2019s licence. After several years of flying choppers, mostly in forestry, Pillat stepped away from that career to spend more time with his two daughters, who are 8 and 11 years old.\n\n\u201cAs a pilot, you\u2019re always in camp. You\u2019re always gone,\u201d he told The Terrace Standard.\n\nNow Pillat owns and operates the Papa Jens donair truck, which can usually be found parked next to Kal Tire in Terrace. Pillat spent months renovating an old motor home to accommodate the donair business, which officially opened on Sept. 1.\n\nPillat explained that donairs in Germany are usually different from donairs in Canada, and he wanted to bring that German style to Terrace.\n\n\u201cOver here it\u2019s usually a wrap,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] I bake my own bread, so it\u2019s more like a fluffy big sandwich.\u201d\n\nPillat said he\u2019s not a professional cook.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a chef, but I can make donairs I guess,\u201d he joked. \u201cI like to cook at home, but nothing fancy, more down to earth, like stew and schnitzel. My girls like it.\u201d\n\nPillat said he likes to joke, though his German sense of humour might not always jive with Canadian senses of humour. He\u2019s already drawing plenty of laughs on social media for his outrageous, informal posts advertising the food truck. One such post featured a risque calendar photo of a muscled, shirtless firefighter \u2014 the post implied that you too could have such a body if you ate at the donair truck daily.\n\nBut Pillat said he takes his work in the food truck very seriously.\n\n\u201cAnything hygiene I don\u2019t joke around. I want everything clean and quality. That\u2019s my worst fear, like to put a bad donair out,\u201d he said.\n\nPillat grew up in a small village near Frankfurt, Germany and he was a bit of a rascal as a teenager, he said. He started his working life as an apprentice cabinet maker. Then, he did a year of military service, which was compulsory for young German men at the time.\n\nWhile most wanted to fail the military intake medical exam, Pillat was eager to pass it and serve as a paratrooper. He aced the medical exam, but was promptly stationed in front of a typewriter for the logistics department. That was baffling to him, he said, because growing up he was always a handy guy who enjoyed wrenching and that type of work.\n\n\u201cWhat do they do? They put me in an office and give me a typewriter \u2026 Just put me on a truck or something, or a forklift,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the other guys that were really smart and knew all that [typing stuff], they [were] put on the trucks and on the forklifts.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s typical military.\u201d\n\nHe went on to work as a professional firefighter in Frankfurt for eight years. During that period, he took a year off and traveled around the world on his BMW motorcycle. The trip was inspired by an old tradition where young German journeymen take an epic hitchhiking journey, equipped with little more than the clothes on their backs, to visit different places to learn more about their trade.\n\nPillat rode his motorbike through the Sahara desert, Russia, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, Norway and other places, visiting fire stations all along the way. He said he learned a lot during that trip and had plenty of wild experiences.\n\nIn Australia, he reached into a fire hydrant to clear out some debris just like he would have done in Germany.\n\n\u201cI did that in Australia, I just wanted to reach in with my bare hands, and the other [firefighter] just kicked me out. \u2018There\u2019s a spider in there!\u2019\u201d\n\nIn Nevada, he had a rough time with the desert heat while he was bundled up in motorcycle riding gear, and the Las Vegas fire department took pity on him.\n\n\u201cI spent three days there in Death Valley, and I come out just like a hillbilly, you know, not shaved, like I\u2019m done. And I knock on the door of the Las Vegas fire station [saying] \u2018Uhhh yeah, I\u2019m a German fireman \u2026\u2019\u201d he said with a chuckle.\n\n\u201cThey looked at me and said \u2018Come on in. We\u2019ll get you a shower and some food to eat.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe first arrived in Canada after visiting New Zealand. His motorcycle was being shipped by boat and wouldn\u2019t arrive for weeks, so he spent that time hitchhiking around Vancouver Island.\n\n\u201cThe first impression is simply the size,\u201d he said of Canada. \u201cFor Germans or Europeans, we can\u2019t imagine the size.\u201d\n\nAfter his bike arrived and he traveled to northern B.C., he began to appreciate the freedom that the open spaces allow. He could simply park his bike and camp next to a creek somewhere.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t even be allowed to do that in Germany. Everything would be private property,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Alaska, he met a German helicopter pilot who let him stay in the hangar for a night. The next day, the pilot took Pillat out for a spin in the helicopter. That\u2019s when Pillat became interested in piloting helicopters. He thought it was achievable because the German pilot he\u2019d met was previously a police officer in Germany.\n\nWhen he returned to Frankfurt and his firefighter job, he began plotting how he would get his pilot\u2019s licence.\n\n\u201cI actually took all my vacation that I had in one year, took it all at once, and I told the flight school in Prince George \u2018I need to get it done in two and a half months,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c[They said] \u2018Okay, that\u2019s doable if you study.\u2019 So I did it and then went back to my job.\u201d\n\nPillat made a buddy in flight school who was from Terrace, so once the immigration process was sorted, Pillat came here in search of work.\n\nFrom then on, he has spent most of his time between Terrace and Germany.\n\nNow, he says, he\u2019s content to run the donair truck and spent as much time as possible with his girls.\n\n\u201cMy girls, they wanted a pony. I said \u2018once we sell one million donairs,\u2019\u201d he laughed. \u201cNow they are counting. \u2018How many did you sell today?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\njake.wray@terracestandard.com\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter",
