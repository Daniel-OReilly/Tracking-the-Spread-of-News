Last year, Kelowna earned third place.\n\nSince GoFundMe launched in Canada in 2010, over half a billion dollars have been raised on the platform. According to GoFundMe, one in seven Canadians give generously on the platform.\n\n\u201cKelowna has moved up in the ranking from last year to the second most generous city in Canada with more donations per capita than most other cities in Canada,\u201d GoFundMe said in a statement.\n\n\u201cKelowna continues to prove its generosity from everesting Knox Mountain to supporting migrant workers.\u201d\n\nDespite a difficult year, GoFundMe said Canadians still managed to help their neighbours and support important causes throughout 2020.\n\nThe most notable fundraising campaigns in Canada include Indigenous allies fundraising to protest against the Coastal GasLink pipeline through Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en territory, a fundraiser for a Vancouver baby\u2019s gene therapy treatment, and a fundraiser for the Sheikh family after their father Kashif drowned in Kelowna on Father\u2019s Day.\n\nREAD: Fundraiser launched for expatriated migrant workers fired from West Kelowna farm\n\nTwila Amato\n\nVideo journalist, Black Press Okanagan\n\nEmail me at twila.amato@blackpress.ca\n\nFollow me on Twitter\n\nBest of 2020",
