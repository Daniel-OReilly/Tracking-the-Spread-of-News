(BC SPCA photo)\n\nThe BC SPCA is ready to start accepting adoption applications for seized horses coming from horrifying conditions on a Princeton farm in September.\n\nThe organization now has legal guardianship for the 97 rescued animals, ensuring they don\u2019t have to go back to their original owner, who left the animals abnormally thin from a lack of food.\n\nIn total, 27 horses, 46 puppies, 21 adult dogs and three cats were rescued by BC SPCA special constables. Several animals later died.\n\nThose who want to adopt one of the recovered horses can fill out an application here.\n\nREAD MORE: 97 distressed horses, cats and dogs seized from farm in Princeton\n\nREAD MORE: Two of 27 horses dead from Princeton farm seizure\n\n@janelle_swift\n\njanelle.swift@castlegarnews.com\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.",
