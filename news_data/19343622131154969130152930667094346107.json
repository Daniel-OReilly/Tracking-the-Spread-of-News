China has continued to increase thermal coal production and power generation, adding to greenhouse gas emissions that are already the world\u2019s largest. (Tom Fletcher/Black Press)\n\nCanada\u2019s transition to \u201cnet zero\u201d greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 includes not only B.C.\u2019s liquefied natural gas exports, but Newfoundland\u2019s offshore oil, Alberta\u2019s oil sands and Ontario\u2019s nuclear power, federal Natural Resources Minister Seamus O\u2019Regan says.\n\nO\u2019Regan kicked off an energy and climate conference in Vancouver Dec. 3 with an upbeat speech on the future of the Canadian oil and gas industry, battered as it is by world market slumps, COVID-19 and a flight of international investment capital from Canada.\n\n\u201cCanada cannot reach its climate goals without the oil and gas industry,\u201d O\u2019Regan said by video link from his office in St. John\u2019s, Newfoundland, where the offshore oil industry is at a near standstill and construction of Husky Energy\u2019s latest offshore platform is being kept alive with federal aid of $41.5 million announced this week.\n\nKey to the net zero goal is B.C.\u2019s LNG industry, led by the LNG Canada export facilities at Kitimat and the Coastal GasLink pipeline from northeast B.C.\u2019s shale gas resources. Bryan Cox, CEO of the Canadian LNG Alliance, said LNG Canada\u2019s plan to be the lowest-emitting producer in the world is getting international attention of investors.\n\nHosted by the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade and law firm Bennett Jones, the conference included Anna Stukas of Carbon Engineering, which has a direct air capture plant at the demonstration stage, pulling carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Stukas said the facility not only creates \u201cnegative emissions\u201d to balance emitting activities such as oil and gas, the captured CO2 can be converted to lower-emission diesel and jet fuel. This is a way reduce emissions in truck and air transportation, two of the most difficult areas to make progress, she said.\n\nRELATED: Horgan campaigns on carbon neutral B.C. by 2050\n\nRELATED: Despite COVID-19, LNG Canada on track to start up\n\nDoug Slater of FortisBC, the province\u2019s main private electricity and gas provider, said his company is pursuing innovations such as compressed natural gas for transport trucks, LNG for shipping to replace diesel and bunker fuel, and applications for hydrogen fuel.\n\nFortis is putting $100 million a year into incentives for household retrofitting and high-efficiency appliances, an approach endorsed by O\u2019Regan.\n\n\u201cI have become a convert of retrofitting homes and businesses,\u201d he said, estimating that as much as 40 per cent of Canada\u2019s commitments to the Paris climate agreement in 2016 can come from that strategy.\n\nO\u2019Regan acknowledged that investment has drained away from Canada, after years of international protest targeting Alberta\u2019s oil sands and B.C.\u2019s natural gas production. Canada became \u201ca box to check\u201d for big companies like Total, Shell and others to demonstrate to shareholders they are doing something about climate change, he said.\n\nBC politicsClimate changeLNG",
