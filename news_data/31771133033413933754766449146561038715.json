Photo by Coastal GasLink.\n\nFrom the City of Dawson Creek to the coastal District of Kitimat, the 670-kilometre Coastal GasLink project spans dozens of local and Indigenous communities.\n\n\u201cAt Coastal GasLink, our success is measured by the breadth of support we see every day from Indigenous and local communities across our project route,\u201d said Kiel Giddens, Coastal GasLink\u2019s Manager of Public Affairs and a Prince George community member. \u201cSeeing everyone come together, from local leaders to our workers and contractors, to safely build this project and support one another has been so inspiring for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur future is being built every day with support from communities, allowing us to achieve important construction milestones,\u201d notes Giddens\n\nThere are more than 3,500 women and men, many of them from Indigenous and local communities along the project route, safely at work on the project.\n\nFor Vanderhoof Mayor Gerry Thiessen, Coastal GasLink is part of their community. \u201cWith everything that\u2019s happened in 2020, and the highs and lows of the forest industry, having a consistent project like Coastal GasLink become part of the community at a time when we\u2019ve needed it has proven to be a real positive benefit to Vanderhoof,\u201d said Mayor Thiessen.\n\nLikewise, Dawson Creek Mayor Dale Bumstead shared how the project builds community. \u201cPeople come to our communities and our cities to live and have a great job and a great quality of life. And that\u2019s what this will do for us,\u201d said Mayor Bumstead.\n\nThe project has also created valuable contracting opportunities for local and Indigenous-owned businesses, allowing them to expand their businesses, employ members, and build capacity for future opportunities.\n\nSaulteau First Nation is one of those communities. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of opportunities brought to us through Coastal GasLink, which has been supremely beneficial for our membership and for the nation as a whole,\u201d said Chief Justin Napoleon from the Saulteau First Nation. \u201cI think that\u2019s been the greatest benefit for us, being able to take on projects ourselves and employ our own members.\u201d\n\nFor Mayor Sarrah Storey, Coastal GasLink is a welcome development for local businesses after years of ups and downs.

Local coffee shops, furniture providers and manufacturers, to name a few, are all helping to build Canada\u2019s largest private sector project.\n\n\u201cWe are really looking forward to the energy this is going to bring to our area and our businesses. Seeing a project like this in our area is huge and very much needed and appreciated,\u201d said Mayor Sarrah Storey of the Village of Fraser Lake.\n\n\u201cThe project is being built not only to benefit northern people and communities today, but with the goal of leaving a lasting, positive legacy for decades to come,\u201d concludes Giddens.\n\nTo learn more about Coastal GasLink and receive project updates, please visit CoastalGasLink.com.\n\nenergy sector",
