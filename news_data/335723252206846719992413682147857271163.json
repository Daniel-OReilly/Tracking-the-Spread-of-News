Photo supplied\n\nA Comox Valley family had a meeting with a humpback whale family recently, between Comox and Texada Island.\n\nCarolyn and Steve Touhey were out on their boat with a friend on Sunday, when they spotted the telltale whale spouts nearby.\n\n\u201cI think there were four [in the pod] \u2013 at one point I thought maybe five, but there were definitely at least four,\u201d Carolyn said. \u201cWe saw the blowholes so we slowed down, but the boat in idle, and just let them go past us.\u201d\n\nCarolyn grabbed her camera, which is equipped with a 60x zoom lens, and recorded the show from a distance.\n\nCarolyn said she had a similar experience at this time last year.\n\n\u201cOn the same memory card I was looking back to November of 2019 and we saw some spectacular humpbacks that time too\u2026 I think people probably think it\u2019s winter so there\u2019s no whale-watching, but the whales don\u2019t leave. We do.\u201d\n\nThe Touheys, who own the Two Eagle Lodge, also had a memorable encounter with a pod of orcas earlier this year.\n\nRELATED: Orcas feeding, splashing and breaching near Hornby Island\n\nSo is it time to expand their bed and breakfast business to a B&B/adventure tours business?\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Carolyn with a laugh. \u201cBut I will never say never.\u201d\n\n\n\nterry.farrell@blackpress.ca\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter\n\nComox ValleyWhales",
