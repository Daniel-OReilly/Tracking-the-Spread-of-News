    "content": "Retired former NDP leader and finance minister Carole James has agreed to B.C. Premier John Horgan\u2019s request to help him navigate the coming year of economic uncertainty due to COVID-19.\n\nHorgan said his long-time friend and colleague in the B.C. legislature since they were both elected in 2005 can offer her expertise and calm leadership in a part-time capacity, as she deals with a Parkinson\u2019s disease diagnosis that led her to announce her retirement last spring. He expressed hope that James would continue longer into the NDP government\u2019s four-year majority mandate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to pay her the princely sum of a dollar,\u201d Horgan told reporters after his new cabinet was sworn in last week by video conference. \u201cI offered her five bucks for a five-year contract. She said, \u2018I\u2019ll take it a dollar at a time.\u2019\u201d\n\nRELATED: B.C. mayors call for resource development role in recovery\n\nRELATED: B.C.\u2019s COVID-19 recovery point man calls for teamwork\n\nCoquitlam-Maillardville MLA Selina Robinson moves from municipal affairs and housing to the finance ministry, inheriting a coronavirus-driven deficit that is closing in on $13 billion for the fiscal year ending in March. Robinson\u2019s first task is to deliver on Horgan\u2019s election promise of pandemic recovery payments of $1,000 per household or $500 per individual to most people in the province, which is expected to add another $1.4 billion to the deficit, then produce another budget for the coming year.\n\nJames led borrowing of $5 billion for B.C.\u2019s initial pandemic relief this summer, including $1,000 payments to anyone who qualified for federal emergency aid due to lost income from COVID-19 restrictions. About $1.5 billion of that remains to be paid out to businesses, another immediate priority of the NDP government.\n\n@tomfletcherbc\n\ntfletcher@blackpress.ca\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nBC legislatureBC politicsCoronavirus",
