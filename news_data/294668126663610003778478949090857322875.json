    "content": "Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix responded Thursday to what appears to be a growing gulf between themselves and some members of the faith community concerning the messaging coming out of their COVID-19 briefings.\n\nReverend Aaron Dyck, of Gateway Baptist Church, has written an open letter to Dix in which he wrote he feels \u201ccompelled as a faith leader to request that people of faith be given the respect that is so overtly presented to every other particular group in this great province.\n\n\u201cThe constant condescension by Dr. Henry, purporting to tell us \u2018what faith is\u2019 and the endless patronization \u2013 as if the government \u2018understands\u2019 anything at all about what constitutes faith itself, let alone its practice \u2013 has long past worn thin,\u201d the reverend wrote.\n\nHenry\u2019s response to this Thursday was that she thinks people sometimes \u201ctake what I say and twist it to make their own ideas about it.\n\n\u201cI have repeatedly said that I have taken advice and have had the privilege of speaking to many faith leaders in the last few months and I appreciate their advice immensely,\u201d she told the Now-Leader.\n\nHenry said she\u2019s learned a \u201ctremendous amount\u201d from faith leaders and has said on occasion what she\u2019s been told about beliefs and about faith. \u201cAnd I do absolutely believe that we need our faith leaders in crises like these, more than ever before, and I really want to give my thanks and praise to the many, many leaders out there who have sent me their advice, their thinking, their thoughts, and the fact that they do understand we need to take measures to protect those that we care most about in our community right now.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Celebrating Easter in Surrey, during COVID-19\n\nREAD ALSO LETTER: Please, some respect for what you have taken\n\nHenry said she doesn\u2019t purport to know everybody\u2019s ideas about faith, but knows there are \u201cgreat leaders\u201d in that community who are \u201cstepping up every day and supporting the people they care about in their congregations and doing it in a safe way, and I just want salute them \u2013 they have my gratitude, and my admiration.\u201d\n\nIn his letter to Dix, the reverend wrote, \u201cGood sir, I beg you: at the risk of alienating permanently the approximately two million British Columbians who practise religion, at least stop pretending that there is somehow a virtual replacement for thousands of years of physical, incarnational ministry. Tell us this is wrong. Tell us this is not OK. Tell us this is, in fact, an evil, however necessary, and stop with the platitudes. We are in your corner, but cannot for much longer be told this \u201cisn\u2019t a big deal\u201d when it comes to practising a faith more than a dozen times older than the nation of Canada itself.\u201d\n\nWhat faith leaders would appreciate, Dyck told Dix, is \u201csome respect for what you have taken from us, the cost to our people, and an acknowledgment that nothing replaces what we have laid down in order to support you and your efforts.\u201d\n\nThe health minister\u2019s response to the reverend is that the provincial government, since the outset of the pandemic, has listened to and reached out to hundreds of faith leaders across B.C. He admitted his idea of faith is not necessarily shared by everyone, but added that \u201cI can tell Reverend Dyck that at our church, that we\u2019ve lost a lot of loved ones this year, including our minister, and the loss of being able to come together on Sunday has been profound for members of that congregation just as they have been for congregations around B.C.\u201d\n\nDix said he\u2019s \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d inspired by the work done by faith communities of all faiths and all denominations to support people in their communities during this difficult time.\n\n\u201cAll I can say is it\u2019s not condescension, it\u2019s gratitude that we feel for the support we get in our community, wherever we find it,\u201d Dix told the Now-Leader. \u201cAnd for many people, that\u2019s in communities of faith. So, we\u2019re with you and we\u2019re asking you to join us in helping in this period to help heal, heal ourselves physically, and protect ourselves and our good health, and also stay healed and stay better as a community.\n\n\u201cI think Dr. Henry has been unbelievably respectful,\u201d Dix said in her defence. \u201cI so admire her approach when she talks about kindness, which is at the core I think of many faiths\u2019 views as well. She lives that every day and I\u2019m so, so proud to stand with her and I just so disagree with the criticism that came in the letter.\u201d\n\n\n\ntom.zytaruk@surreynowleader.com\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow Tom on Twitter\n\nCoronavirusSurrey",
