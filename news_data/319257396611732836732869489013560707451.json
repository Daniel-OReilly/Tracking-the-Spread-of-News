(Photo: K-J Millar/The Northern View)\n\nLouisa Parent is a daughter, a mother, a fianc\u00e9e, and also a volunteer at the Moose Lodge in Prince Rupert.\n\nGrowing up First Nations in Prince Rupert she learned from an early age how to look after other people, being the eldest to her five younger siblings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the oldest in my family. Our ways, our culture, and our beliefs \u2014 the eldest girl has a lot of responsibility,\u201d Louisa said. She said she took a mother-like role to her youngest brother.\n\nOn the day she spoke to The Northern View, she was busy bustling around downtown running errands, taking care of an ill family member, and preparing to make her brother Owen\u2019s birthday a special one with a cake, a banner, party hats, and special, oversized satin glittered comedic necktie for the birthday man.\n\nCommitment to family is important to Louisa. She has always worked to provide stability and everything her family has needed. She spent many years as a single mother balancing studying, looking after her children, and volunteer work.\n\nLouisa has studied many different topics like First Nations Arts, womens\u2019 studies, child and youth worker program. She said it has all been positive for her. She said she continued to take training courses as her family grew up so she could better herself.\n\n\u201cI did what I had to do to support and help my family,\u201d she said.\n\nREAD MORE: Heart of our City \u2013 Swimming in the Street\n\nShe said she has carried over what she learned while studying into her paid employment and volunteer work. Her first experience with volunteering was as a parent volunteer while at her children\u2019s school.\n\n\u201cThey had a Friday Nights Alive program, where the kids would come to the school and do computers, arts and crafts, and play the gym. It was fun for them and gave them something to do. I was a volunteer supervisor there,\u201d she said.\n\nLouisa and her children moved away from Prince Rupert for a while after her marriage dissolved and her parents passed away within a year of each other. She missed Prince Rupert and her high school-aged children wanted to come back. She moved back to help everyone and so she could be there for them.\n\n\u201cPrince Rupert is my home. I like the water and the ocean. I love the smell of the saltwater air,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile living in Nanaimo she would walk to the water every day to a nice park, she said.\n\n\u201cThe sea air is not the same \u2026 it just didn\u2019t quite smell the same. I don\u2019t know what it is. The seas air \u2014 having grown up in Prince Rupert you just don\u2019t forget it.\u201d\n\nShe said everyone in her family from her grandfather and uncles, has worked in fishing in one capacity or another. She too worked in the canning industry.\n\n\u201cEveryone worked on boats, or fishing or in the canneries. It\u2019s a big part of Prince Rupert\u2019s history all up and down the coast here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know it rains here a lot and some people don\u2019t like it, but it\u2019s home,\u201d Louisa said.\n\nAfter her children grew up and left the nest she said she was on her own and needed to fill her time.\n\n\u201cLots of places, anywhere you go, have programs running that need volunteers,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you hear that, look into it. You will enjoy it and learn a lot. Volunteering will make you feel better.\u201d\n\nWhile working in a temporary contract position at the Friendship House, Louisa saw how important volunteering is and how it can change someone\u2019s life.\n\nAfter work, she would volunteer with the Elders in a weekly program where they would fundraise with bake and food sales. She would assist them with shopping and cooking. She said while she was wanting to help and assist them, she was receiving joy from the program as she loved hearing all of the interesting stories the Elders would share.\n\nREAD MORE: Heart of our city \u2013 New pastors want to journey along side\n\nLouisa started volunteering at the Moose Lodge about two years ago. She has been playing darts for about five years on a mixed-team in the league that plays weekly. She met her fianc\u00e9 Ken there, who also volunteers some of his time at the Moose Lodge. Apart from relaxing with darts, her volunteering helps out in the office with some admin duties and also behind the bar looking after members\u2019 thirsts being quenched.\n\n\u201cI felt a little bit overwhelmed at first. I thought it may be a big boys club,\u201d she said laughing. \u201cBut then I thought, I\u2019m tough I\u2019m not going to allow them to bump out. It\u2019s funny, I take my stuff seriously and stick to my guns. I can see them cringe now sometimes when I walk in. They know I\u2019m watching them.\u201d\n\nShe is full of praise and support for her fellow volunteers and said they are very dedicated and spend many hours every day there, even though they have jobs outside of the volunteering.\n\nLouisa extolled that all the team at the Moose Lodge is wonderful to work with, and thankfully they haven\u2019t played any tricks on her yet.\n\n\u201cAnyone can volunteer. You can do just one day a week. It still helps. Even if you have just a couple of hours of free time it really does help.\u201d\n\nK-J Millar | Journalist\n\nemail\n\nLike the The Northern View on Facebook\n\nFollow us on Twitter Send K-JLike theonFollow us on\n\n\n\nSign up here Get local stories you won't find anywhere else right to your inbox.",
