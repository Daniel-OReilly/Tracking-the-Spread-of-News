She substituted the cigarette between Kahlo\u2019s fingers with a thermometer.\n\nArcher posted her photo to Instagram and on the popular website Reddit, where it fast became one of the day\u2019s top posts, viewed by hundreds of thousands of people.\n\n\u201cI was hoping to just make people laugh for a little bit. The symbolism was there and colour was there,\u201d Alana said. \u201cThe response was incredible. It just took off like wildfire.\u201d\n\nThe Kelowna artist\u2019s image was inspired by the Getty Museum Challenge, an online callout to re-create art using a small number of objects lying around the home. The challenge went viral during the first couple weeks of pandemic isolation, and social media feeds were populated with creative and funny interpretations.\n\nPeople commenting on Alana\u2019s posting quickly pointed out the reproduction was missing the original artist\u2019s distinct unibrow.\n\n\u201cThere was so much controversy about the eyebrows, and it was interesting how people were interpreting it,\u201d said Alana. \u201cSome people were taking personal digs at me and saying I completely missed the mark. I took it all with a grain of salt. It was fascinating seeing people\u2019s spectrum of reaction.\u201d\n\nInspired, Alana delved deeper into Kahlo\u2019s art and re-created another piece, Self-Portrait with Braid. She included the unibrow this time and incorporated a PlayStation controller as the necklace. Alana\u2019s play on that portrait was printed in People Magazine. Her re-creations were also featured through PBS NewsHour.\n\nThe exposure helped her pick up more fans and followers on social media at an important time in her art career\u2014one that has involved going through her own transformation. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in her being laid off from her job in interior design. As a result, she switched her focus to her own art.\n\nREAD MORE: Brewing Success\n\n\u201cI\u2019m keeping up with my personal projects. I\u2019ve been running a separate art and painting company on the side for a few years. It\u2019s been a bit of a hobby, but now it\u2019s getting my full attention,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there\u2019s lots of opportunity right now for people to just jump in and be a little bit entrepreneurial and make opportunities for themselves. And I think now, more than ever, people are wanting art to feel connected, and for things to be exciting again.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s stayed busy on Instagram and her website, getting updates done that she had previously put off.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s getting really creative in different ways.\u201d\n\nAlana tries to express a humanitarian message through her work.\n\nHer dad is from the Republic of Chad, in central Africa, and her mom is Canadian. They were \u201cpretty nomadic,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI was back and forth quite a bit throughout my childhood.\u201d\n\nAlana has spent time in France, Spain and Portugal\u2014connecting with family and exploring. She said experiencing different places and cultures, especially Third World countries, has helped her appreciate things more.\n\nHer dad worked in construction and she spent time around the different trades. Her mom enjoyed experimenting with artistic pursuits, switching up mediums often\u2014from pastels to sewing.\n\n\u201cI got the best of both of their worlds, I think,\u201d she said.\n\nAlana pursued interior design after high school, studying at the Centre for Arts and Technology in Kelowna. Still, as much as she loved interior design, she found it incredibly fast-paced and detail-oriented. The construction side of the business also has its own inherent challenges.\n\n\u201cHaving my layoff now, I\u2019ve been given the opportunity to just dive full force into my own artwork,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been diving into a lot of resin art recently. It\u2019s one of my more exciting mediums to play with because it has a mind of its own and it will not be controlled. It\u2019s like watching a story unfold right in front of your eyes.\u201d\n\nArt using resin is a big investment of time and materials. There are multiple layers on top of each other that can be manipulated, or left to level out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a material that you have to listen to. It\u2019s definitely interactive. There are times it co-operates and times that it doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m still learning how to tame it. Everything has a lot of energy, a lot of colour.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also a delicate material; resin reacts to chemicals in the air and to temperature.\n\nOne of her more complex pieces is a round, abstract work with six materials creating cohesion in chaos. It plays together and reacts. Another piece, called Extraneous, was displayed recently as part of the Kelowna Art Gallery\u2019s exhibition for local artists.\n\nShe\u2019s recently been working on a 30-inch round birch canvas, layering it with resin and also incorporating mirrored glass.\n\nAll of the proceeds from this year\u2019s sales of Alana\u2019s art will be donated to the Kelowna General Hospital Foundation.\n\nFor more information, visit alanaarcher.net.\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nLifestyle",
