That same know-how began doing so much more.\n\n\u201cLike a lot of others in our industry, when COVID-19 started, we wanted to help address the immediate need \u2013 creating the sanitizer and shipping free to those who needed it, including 2,000 litres to Vancouver General Hospital,\u201d explains distillery owner Patrick Evans.\n\nRamping up volume to produce the sanitizer in the most cost-effective way, today Shelter Point has distributed more than 100,000 litres. \u201cAfter donating several thousand litres of sanitizer initially, it was really important that we provide the product at a fair price, possible by producing on a larger scale,\u201d Evans says.\n\n\u201cAnd our formula doesn\u2019t add a foaming agent or thickening gel so it doesn\u2019t dry your hands out. We studied the formula according to the World Health Organization, then used a charcoal filtering process to make it as pure as possible.\u201d\n\nMaking a difference a little differently\n\nWhile other distillers are bottling individual sizes, focusing on larger-size products lets Shelter Point serve organizations like the RCMP, Department of National Defence, Fraser Health Authority, and school districts. For individual bottles, they\u2019ve partnered with Purica in Cowichan Valley.\n\n\u201cIt just took off and now we\u2019ve shipped across Canada,\u201d Evans says. \u201cWe were working full-on to ensure we didn\u2019t have to tell people we were sold out.\u201d\n\nToday, a dedicated sanitizer production area is separate from whisky production, with additional employees to accommodate production.\n\nAs awareness grows \u2013 and with it the distillery\u2019s capacity to produce more \u2013 they\u2019re also now distributing to retailers. \u201cWe started just wanting to be part of the solution, but we\u2019ve had such a strong demand, this is a long term product for us,\u201d Evans says.\n\nTo learn more, visit shelterpoint.ca, and to support the local community, discounts on sanitizer are available for those paying at the distillery, 4650 Regent Rd., Campbell River.\n\nCoronavirusLocal Business",
