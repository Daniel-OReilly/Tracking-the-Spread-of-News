(Clare Rayment photo)\n\nAfter almost 20 years in the works, the film adaptation of Haisla author Eden Robinson\u2019s Monkey Beach premiered at Tillicum Twin Theatres in Terrace last Thursday (Sept. 24) evening.\n\nOriginally published in 2000, Robinson\u2019s novel focuses on a young Haisla girl named Lisa who returns to Kitamaat Village after several years away, when her younger brother goes missing at sea. Told through Lisa\u2019s current explorations and past dreams and memories, Lisa reflects on the current situation and her life as she waits to hear news about her brother.\n\nThe premiere was part of the Vancouver International Film Festival (VIFF) and the theatre was given 17 screenings of the film in Terrace, with 50 people maximum at each screening. Tillicum Twin Theatres owner, Diane Robinson, said all the screenings sold out in advance.\n\nREAD MORE: \u2018Monkey Beach\u2019 supernatural film adaptation premiers at VIFF\n\nREAD MORE: Local Kitimat authors make Canadian bestsellers list\n\nEden Robinson, the book\u2019s author, was present at the premiere and for a panel discussion after. Two of the film\u2019s actors, local mother-daughter duo Erica Davis and Tiyanee Stevens from Terrace, were also on the panel.\n\nDavis said it was her first time acting in a film and she was incredibly nervous to work with some of the film\u2019s big-name actors, including Adam Beach (Suicide Squad, Cowboys & Aliens) and Glen Gould (Cardinal, Murdoch Mysteries).\n\n\u201cIt was pretty overwhelming. I was super nervous. It was all very, very new to me,\u201d Davis said. \u201cActing behind the camera is very, very different than being on stage in theatre. And then I noticed that, I did my best to learn the lines that were in the script and everybody else just sort of winged it.\u201d\n\nStevens said the biggest difference for her between stage and film was the difference in one\u2019s physical acting.\n\n\u201cAnd also just acting on stage, it\u2019s all dependent on where your audience is, because yes, you have audience members right up at the front, but you also have audience members way at the back,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cYou sort of have to exaggerate your facial expressions and your movements, whereas on screen, the camera\u2019s, like, right there in your face. So, you can be a lot more subtle and realistic.\u201d\n\nThe movie was filmed on-site in Kitimat and Kitamaat Village in 2018 and Robinson said finally seeing her book come to life on the big screen was an absolutely surreal experience.\n\n\u201cThat was, I keep saying surreal, but I genuinely mean it,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, when something is in the planning stages for so long, and then it\u2019s alive in the world, it\u2019s just beyond words.\u201d\n\nRobinson said that, as an author, it\u2019s always hard to have your book adapted for screen because they can never include everything, but that she understood why the changes had to be made.\n\n\u201cFrom my really bad attempt at the first script, I could see why they had to make the structural changes that they did. And then there were more logistic changes they had to make just because any of the water scenes were going to be, like, super pricey.\u201d\n\nHowever, she added that, \u201cI think they hit all the main points. I mean, there were things that didn\u2019t make it into book that I wished were still in there!\u201d\n\nRobinson said one of the main differences between the book and the film was the ending, as the film\u2019s ending was a lot more conclusive than the book\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI am a huge, huge fan of open endings, but I don\u2019t think many others are,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cI think that the movie gives a lot more closure and it still manages to be ambiguous, and I don\u2019t think movie audiences would be as tolerant of the kind of ending that I like.\u201d\n\nRobinson said she always liked writing open endings because of how constricted most books endings are.\n\n\u201cWhen I was coming up, a lot of the books that were geared towards our curriculum were heavily moralistic. They were, you know, \u2018This is the moral. We\u2019re going to hammer in the moral, and then we\u2019re going to tell you exactly what everything means, and, you know, you don\u2019t have to think. This is the ending, this is the only interpretation of the ending we will accept,\u2019 \u201d Robinson said.\n\n\u201cAnd that always annoyed me. So, when I started writing, I thought it would be more empowering if the reader could have more say in how the book ends.\u201d\n\nRobinson\u2019s favourite part about the open ending of Monkey Beach was seeing all the different endings that readers created for themselves.\n\n\u201cWhen people tell me how they think the book ended, that just gives me a window into them,\u201d she said. \u201cFor them, that is the ending.\u201d\n\nAnd while the film\u2019s ending was slightly more conclusive, Robinson said she still found the film very enjoyable, and found it especially nice that they were able to film on-site.\n\n\u201cIt was particularly powerful seeing the local areas in the film of Monkey Beach,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIt was one of those glorious, late-summer falls [when they were filming], where the weather was absolutely, just amazing. It was perfect, it was sunny. What I\u2019m afraid of though, is that people will watch the movie and then come up expecting all this sunshine!\u201d\n\nHer biggest regret was that she wasn\u2019t able to be on set for most of the time filming because she was on tour for her book Trickster Drift, the second in her Trickster trilogy.\n\n\u201cWhen I was here, I tried to be on set as much as possible, or in the background,\u201d Robinson said, adding that the easiest part of the whole process was \u201cwatching just the wealth of talent that the North has. There were just so many people who came together to make that film.\u201d\n\n\u201cWatching their hard word come to fruition was just one of the biggest highlights for me,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nGiven the cast was all Indigenous actors and that they filmed in Kitamaat Village and other local areas, Robinson said she felt the Haisla culture and supernatural traditions portrayed in the film were done well.\n\nAlong with Monkey Beach, the TV series Trickster, based on Robinson\u2019s book trilogy, is set to air on CBC Gem on Oct. 7 and recently premiered the first two episodes at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).\n\n\u201cAll of it coming in the craziest year of my existence, it\u2019s just kind of [insane],\u201d Robinson said. \u201cI\u2019m still stunned. That it would all come together this year, I\u2019m hoping isn\u2019t a sign that the world is ending. Like, \u2018here\u2019s your high point. Bye!\u2019 I think if I win the lotto, the world is doomed.\u201d\n\nRobinson said she doesn\u2019t have any more book-to-film adaptations in the works at the moment, but has a few ideas about what she wants to write for her next book.\n\n\u201cI know what I want to write next, but we\u2019ll see what the muse does with, you know, what\u2019s happening in the world, what\u2019s happening with me.\u201d\n\nRobinson added that many of her biggest supporters have been from the North, and she\u2019s so thankful to everyone for all of their support throughout the entire process and for inspiring her stories throughout the years.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a takeaway here, it\u2019s that your stories are important,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThe world needs more of your stories.\u201d\n\n\n\nclare.rayment@northernsentinel.com\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter",
