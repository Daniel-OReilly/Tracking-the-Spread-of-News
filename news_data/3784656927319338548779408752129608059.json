(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill)\n\nHe may be leaving Toronto, but Serge Ibaka says he\u2019ll always be a Raptor.\n\nThe 31-year-old took to social media Sunday to dole out thanks for his time with the team, saying \u201cthe love I have received on this journey I will never forget.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had great teammates, front office and staff next to me. And of course, a fan base that is second to none,\u201d said the post, which accompanied a black and white photo of Ibaka walking off the court and into a plethora of outstretched hands.\n\n\u201cSo thank you Toronto. Thank you, Canada. And thank you Raptors. I am one of yours forever. #WeTheNorth.\u201d\n\nHis message comes amid multiple reports that Ibaka, a free agent, has signed a two-year, US$19-million contract with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nThe seven-foot forward came to Toronto in a trade with the Orlando Magic in 2017, and played a crucial role in helping the squad win its 2019 championship title.\n\nIbaka said in his post that he felt \u201cat home from day one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel really blessed to have played for this city, these fans, and this organization,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is really a great organization that takes care of its players and I\u2019m thankful that I became an NBA Champion with them.\u201d\n\nHow to explain what Toronto, Canada, and the Raptors mean to me? I was welcomed to a new country and a new team more than three years ago and I felt at home from day one. I feel really blessed to have played for this city, these fans, and this organization. pic.twitter.com/ptCtzVCs0c \u2014 Serge Ibaka (@sergeibaka) November 22, 2020\n\nIn 2017, he signed a three-year, US$65-million contract with the Raptors, cementing his place as Toronto\u2019s centre.\n\nIbaka averaged 15.4 points per game and 8.2 rebounds a game with the Raptors last season.\n\nHe\u2019s also well-known for his off-court personality, the Mafuzzy Chef, who gained notoriety for the YouTube series \u201cHow Hungry Are You?\u201d where he cooked unique meals \u2014 including fried snake and a sandwich made of bull testicles \u2014 for his teammates and other NBA stars.\n\nHailing from the Republic of Congo, Ibaka was picked 24th overall by the Oklahoma City Thunber in the 2008 NBA draft after spending time playing basketball in Spain.\n\nREAD MORE: VanVleet staying with Raptors on 4-year deal\n\nThe Canadian Press\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nWant to support local journalism during the pandemic?
