Sam became the first publicly gay player to be drafted in the NFL. He signed with the Montreal Alouettes after being released by St. Louis, but abruptly left after playing one game. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang\n\nChris Voth\u2019s sexuality cost him a job with a professional volleyball team overseas four years ago.\n\nThe Winnipeg native, who has never named the team nor country, was told outright that the club wasn\u2019t interested in having a gay player.\n\nThe 30-year-old came out publicly seven years ago because he hoped to be a role model for young LGBTQ athletes, and given the chance to go back and change that, he wouldn\u2019t.\n\nBut Voth was disheartened to learn that the majority of gay athletes still don\u2019t come out, and that homophobic language on the field or court remains rampant \u2014 and Canada is among the worst offenders.\n\n\u201cThat was disappointing, because I always like to think that we\u2019re a bit more further ahead up north (compared to the U.S.),\u201d said Voth, recently home from coaching in the Netherlands.\n\nThe former national team player was responding to two studies released Thursday by Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nThe first study analyzed survey responses from 1,173 lesbian, gay and bisexual people aged 15 to 21 living in Canada, the U.S., Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland.\n\nThe study found that about 48 per cent of Canadian youth who come out to teammates reported being the target of homophobic behaviour, including bullying, assaults and slurs \u2014 and it was more prevalent among Canadian youth than Americans (45 per cent).\n\nAmong females, 44 per cent of Canadians who\u2019ve come out to teammates reported being victimized \u2014 more than any other country surveyed by Monash\u2019s Behavioural Sciences Research Laboratory.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy for Canadians to dismiss the data and say, \u2018No, no, that\u2019s not in our country. We\u2019re inclusive and welcoming. And we\u2019re known around the world for being friendly and polite and nice,\u2019\u201d said lead author Erik Denison, who\u2019s Canadian.\n\n\u201cCanada has been a laggard globally, full stop. There\u2019s no other way to say that.\u201d\n\nYoung people who came out were significantly more likely (58 per cent versus 40 per cent) to report they\u2019d been the target of homophobic behaviors in sport settings than those who didn\u2019t, the study found.\n\nEvery study over the past 15 years has shown that LGBTQ kids play sport at lower rates than straight kids, Denison said, and while there\u2019s a perception that the gap is more prevalent in boys than girls, that\u2019s not accurate.\n\n\u201cAnd seeing these big gaps in participation, I can only use the word alarming,\u201d said Denison. \u201cWe\u2019re really alarmed about both discrimination in sport, and the fact these kids are avoiding sport.\n\n\u201cBecause the No. 1 thing we could be doing to reduce rates of suicide and self-harm is encouraging these kids to become active in safe and supportive environments.\u201d\n\nNumerous studies have shown that suicide attempts and ideation about suicide are significantly higher in LGBTQ kids.\n\nVoth\u2019s experiences as an out athlete varied wildly. The 30-year-old believes discrimination cost him spots on several pro clubs, contract negotiations inexplicably stalling with no explanation. On the other hand, when he signed with a pro team in Finland, he was \u201cthe first gay person that any of them had met. And only a month-and-a-half later, we were the first pro volleyball team to walk in a pride parade. So it can really go either way.\u201d\n\nVoth said LGBTQ youth are doubly impacted, losing out on the mental health benefits that come from being part of a team.\n\nThe second Monash study investigated why some athletes use homophobic language.\n\nDenison pointed out that while there are \u201chomophobes, racists and sexist people everywhere,\u201d they tend to control their behaviour around others.\n\n\u201cThe opposite is happening in sport. In sport, the culture is very supportive of homophobic language being used,\u201d he said. \u201cCanadian sport has three official languages: French, English and homophobic language.\u201d\n\nAnd while most people believe it\u2019s slurs aimed at opponents during games, their studies found that homophobic language is being used at practices, in the locker-room, and at social events, as jokes and banter.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re not just talking about words like \u2018gay,\u2019 we asked about much more severe language,\u2019\u201d Denison said.\n\nHe is working with the University of British Columbia among other schools around the world on a program aimed to train team captains to be leaders on this issue, because coaches can\u2019t necessarily create change, it\u2019s more effective when it comes from an athlete\u2019s peers.\n\nDenison said that Volleyball Canada is the only national sport organization in the country that has done work specifically targeting homophobia, and it occurred around the same time Voth came out publicly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to denigrate what the NHL (among other leagues) has done, but at the end of the day, the NHL is a professional sporting organization, they\u2019re ultimately a business,\u201d Denison said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to Hockey Canada, it\u2019s up to Soccer Canada, it\u2019s up to Rugby Canada, it\u2019s up to those bodies and provincial bodies as well to be driving change.\u201d\n\nThe Canadian Olympic Committee has done anti-homophobia social media campaigns, mall installations, and regularly marches in pride parades across the country.\n\nPro sports teams such as Toronto FC and the Toronto Raptors host annual pride games.\n\nDenison said his research, however, has shown those initiatives do little to reduce homophobic behaviour and language among fans. He\u2019d rather see pro teams work with teams and programs at the grassroots level to hold their own pride games, among other initiatives.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is that when amateur-level teams hold pride games, the players on those teams use half the homophobic language than those who don\u2019t hold these events,\u201d Denison said. \u201cThese events are really good at getting those conversations going around \u2018Hey, guys, what kind of language do we actually want on our team?\u2019 That\u2019s where we can change those norms and culture, we think quite effectively.\u201d\n\nDenison pointed out that there are openly-LGBTQ people in entertainment, government, and major corporations, but by comparison, they largely remain invisible in sports, particularly on the men\u2019s side, and have since David Kopay came out in 1975 after he retired from the NFL. He\u2019s believed to be the first pro athlete to come out.\n\nMichael Sam became the first publicly gay player to be drafted in the NFL. He signed with the Montreal Alouettes after being released by St. Louis, but abruptly left after playing one game.\n\nBrooklyn Nets forward Jason Collins came out in 2013, and former Major League Soccer midfielder Collin Martin followed suit in 2018. Collins has retired, and Martin plays in the USL, and there have been no active gay players in any of the five major North American sports leagues since.\n\nWomen\u2019s pro sport has been a different story. Sports power couple Sue Bird and Megan Rapinoe are two of the numerous out athletes in the WNBA, NWSL, and other women\u2019s leagues.\n\nFor Denison, Canada\u2019s track record is particularly disheartening.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite embarrassing for me as a Canadian researcher who happens to be down in Australia now to see that Canada is a laggard. Because I\u2019m a proud Canadian, and I think Canadians have a reputation for being friendly and inclusive.\n\n\u201cBut it looks like either Canadians have been ignoring this issue, we\u2019re not aware of this issue, or worse, maybe there\u2019s some deliberate resistance to do anything about this problem.\u201d\n\nLori Ewing, The Canadian Press\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nWant to support local journalism?
