Premier John Horgan\u2019s campaign promises are going to lead to higher taxes and debt.\n\nSpeaking after his first post-election cabinet meeting Dec. 2, Horgan defended his key election promise to send out $1,000 to households and $500 to individuals. The B.C. legislature is being called into a brief session next week to authorize the additional borrowing, with the current-year deficit already near $13 billion and next year\u2019s budget still to come.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s prudent to do it because it\u2019s putting dollars into people\u2019s pockets so they can continue to get through the most challenging time British Columbians have ever known,\u201d Horgan said. \u201cThis is going to be means tested, it\u2019s going to be low-income families and individuals who will get access to resources that they wouldn\u2019t have had otherwise.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cmeans test\u201d was partially revealed in the NDP campaign platform, after Horgan added the payments to counter a B.C. Liberal promise to suspend sales tax next year. The one-time direct payment goes to families with annual income under $125,000, \u201cwith a sliding scale up to $175,000.\u201d For single individuals, the \u201csliding scale\u201d reduces $500 payments from $62,000 to $87,000 income.\n\nLegislation to be tabled next week will show the actual reductions for higher income earners, and whether any test of lost income is to be used.\n\nRELATED: Federal COVID-19 payments swell bank accounts: CIBC\n\nRELATED: Horgan launches platform with $1,000 COVID payments\n\nRELATED: Another $1 billion borrowed for municipalities, transit\n\nD\u2019Avignon notes that B.C. residents have already collected $9 billion in Canada Emergency Relief Benefit (CERB) payments, the second highest of any province. Federal spending has been highest among developed countries, pushing average income up 11 per cent even as the economy contracted.\n\nMeanwhile, B.C.\u2019s economic growth before the pandemic was driven almost entirely by energy projects.\n\n\u201cIf not for LNG Canada, Site C, Trans Mountain pipeline and some office towers in Vancouver and Victoria, we would have been essentially flat,\u201d he said.\n\nRavi Kahlon, B.C.\u2019s new minister of jobs and economic recovery, pointed to latest Statistics Canada labour force survey as a sign that B.C. is coming out of the COVID-19 recession.\n\n\u201cSince the pandemic\u2019s most severe impact on the economy in April, B.C. has had substantial job growth for seven consecutive months, bringing our total employment to 98.5 per cent of pre-pandemic levels,\u201d Kahlon said Friday. \u201cThis is the highest job recovery rate of any of Canada\u2019s four largest provinces.\u201d\n\n@tomfletcherbc\n\ntfletcher@blackpress.ca\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nBC politicsCoronavirus",
