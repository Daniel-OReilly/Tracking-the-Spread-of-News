The record-breaking number of COVID cases, the new health protocols being put in place, partial lockdowns and the threat of Christmas being cancelled have all weighed heavily on a lot of us.\n\nThe snow dumps haven\u2019t helped, only because I hate cleaning off my car and driving through it. My kids have enjoyed sledding and playing in it, which is the silver lining.\n\nBut overall, I\u2019m glad last week is behind us. Everything has felt so heavy. It\u2019s been hard for me to find joy in the small things.\n\nI\u2019ve felt the pressure to try and keep things as normal as possible for my children while the world seems to be in chaos. I know kids are resilient but raising them during a pandemic is hard.\n\nI was in a funk all week and I think my five-year-old has noticed. She came up to me one day and told me she\u2019s learning how to tell jokes. She asked me why the chicken crossed the road so I told her I didn\u2019t know, waiting for her to respond and she just stared blankly back at me, I think waiting for an answer.\n\nHer heart was in the right place, even if the punch line wasn\u2019t.\n\nI tried explaining how jokes worked, but I couldn\u2019t remember any that were age appropriate. So we went to Google and found some on the internet.\n\nHere are our favourites. Maybe they\u2019ll bring you a slight smile or you can try and cheer your children up with one or two if they need it.\n\nWhy are fish so smart?\n\nBecause they live in schools!\n\nWhere do polar bears keep their money?\n\nIn snow banks!\n\nWhy is Cinderella bad at soccer?\n\nBecause she is always running away from the ball!\n\nWhere do cows go on Friday nights?\n\nThe mooooo-vies!\n\nWhat did one snowman say to the other snowman?\n\nIt smells like carrots over here!\n\nREAD MORE: Let\u2019s not drag this COVID thing out\n\nMaybe laughter is the best medicine. Research has shown that laughter can relieve stress and can even boost the immune system. There was even a study done in Europe that found people with a strong sense of humour outlived those who don\u2019t laugh as much.\n\nI know, it can be hard right now to smile. Sometimes it helps to actually count your blessings.\n\nOr ask the person next to you what the funniest thing they\u2019ve heard this week is.\n\nMaybe you\u2019ll both get a good chuckle and even if its just for a couple of minutes, maybe the coronavirus cloud hanging over your head will disappear.\n\n@MariscaDekkema\n\nmarisca.bakker@interior-news.com\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nParenting",
