The Zoom app has become the most downloaded app on iPhones and iPads this year. Almost 60 per cent of people said they\u2019re planning on having virtual celebrations with their families over the holidays.\n\nHalf of the participants who were surveyed said they are planning to make more frequent phone calls with their loved ones, which may be related to the 10 per cent increase in cellphone purchases.\n\nBC Hydro shares some recommendations for British Columbians to improve their energy efficiency over the winter months, including streaming movies or TV shows on a device like a smart TV can help save up to 40 per cent in electricity usage, instead of using a gaming console.\n\nAlso, taking monitor size into consideration, a 17-inch screen uses 30 per cent more energy than a 15-inch display size.\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nWant to support local journalism?
