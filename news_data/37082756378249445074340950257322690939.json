Judged contest has been put on hold.\n\nNorthern Society for Domestic Peace\u2019s (NSDP) charity pageant where men dress as women, normally draws a huge crowd and a lot of money is raised for men\u2019s programs to end violence against women.\n\n\u201cWe usually raise upwards of $40,000,\u201d said NSDP Executive Director Carol Seychuk. \u201cIt is for our men\u2019s program that doesn\u2019t have core funding from the ministry.\u201d\n\nNSDP has applied for some grants to help make up for the shortfall and will use other fundraising money to run the programs.\n\nHowever, Seychuk added the funds raised from the event aren\u2019t the only thing that will be missed.\n\n\u201cThe community connection we get with Mz. Judged is something else we will miss. It gives us contact with people we might not normally get and it allows us to provide some education in the community,\u201d she added. \u201cIt is very much a community event for us, we are missing that much.\u201d\n\nNSDP has not decided yet if it will hold the event next year or wait another two years.\n\ndomestic violence",
