Supreme Court where Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou was attending a hearing, in Vancouver, on Tuesday January 21, 2020. In his darkest moments, Michael Kovrig draws strength from knowing that his fellow Canadians and people around the world are working to free him and Michael Spavor from their respective Chinese prison cells. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck\n\nIn his darkest moments, Michael Kovrig draws strength from knowing that his fellow Canadians and people around the world are working to free him and Michael Spavor from their respective Chinese prison cells.\n\nAs much as that matters, Kovrig\u2019s wife Vina Nadjibulla says he is also subjecting himself to a strict regimen to strengthen his mind and body because he views that as the key to his survival.\n\nShe says that not only is Kovrig determined to survive his ordeal, he wants to reclaim his freedom better and stronger than when he lost it.\n\nKovrig and Spavor are marking two years in separate Chinese prisons, on what Canada and dozens of its Western allies say are trumped-up espionage charges in retaliation for the RCMP\u2019s December 2018 arrest of Chinese high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant.\n\nCanada\u2019s ambassador to China, Dominic Barton, one of the few outsiders to see them, said this week Kovrig and Spavor are anything but broken men, and that seeing how they\u2019ve endured their captivity was inspiring.\n\nKovrig is \u201cmarshalling every ounce of his willpower and strength\u201d to cope with his difficult situation, Nadjibulla said in an interview this week.\n\n\u201cHe says that knowing that Canadians care, knowing that the world cares, and people are fighting for his release, makes him feel stronger, and keeps hope alive,\u201d she said, drawing on letters that he has written in captivity.\n\n\u201cHe hopes that he will be able to come out from this experience not only having survived it, but with a commitment, with resolve to rebuild his life better, to contribute even more to society.\u201d\n\nA statement from Global Affairs on Thursday to The Canadian Press said that Canadian Embassy officials in Beijing spoke directly with Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials to clarify a media report earlier in the morning that suggested the two Michaels had gone on trial in China.\n\nThe statement said that \u201ccontrary to what has been reported in the media this morning, there has been no development in the cases of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.\u201d\n\nThe statement also said that \u201cthe confusion was caused by an inaccurate characterization of the process made by the Chinese MFA spokesperson.\u201d\n\nThe Canadian Press also reached out, through intermediaries, to request interviews with Spavor\u2019s friends and family but was unsuccessful. Spavor worked as an entrepreneur in the Chinese city of Dandong, where he is imprisoned near the North Korean border.\n\nKovrig was most recently an analyst with the International Crisis Group in Washington and before that he was a member of Canada\u2019s diplomatic corps, a career focused on preventing deadly conflicts.\n\n\u201cHe hopes that he can continue to do that, and he can rejoin the broader conversation in the world with life and not just continue to be isolated and cut off in the way that he is,\u201d said Nadjibulla.\n\nShe said Kovrig is devouring books from the meditations of stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius, to St. Paul\u2019s Letter to the Romans, to Tolstoy\u2019s \u201cWar and Peace,\u201d to Nelson Mandela\u2019s \u201cLong Walk to Freedom.\u201d He\u2019s reread one of his pre-prison favourites, \u201cAntifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder\u201d by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, because it contains a key message for him.\n\n\u201cIt essentially posits that it\u2019s important to cultivate an ability to not only survive traumas or disruptions but to become better and stronger as a result. So, this idea of building back better. I know it\u2019s very much on the minds of many of us as we recover from the pandemic,\u201d she said.\n\nREAD MORE: Kovrig, Spavor are \u2018inspiring\u2019 and \u2018robust\u2019 in Chinese prison, says Canada\u2019s envoy\n\nKovrig is also drawing on stoic philosophical teaching that, among other things, calls for the transformation of \u201cfear into prudence, pain into information,\u201d said Nadjibulla. Kovrig has added \u201canger into the termination of grievance\u201d to that philosophy.\n\nHe has been drawn to St. Paul\u2019s Letter to the Romans, the sixth book of the New Testament, \u201cwhich says suffering produces endurance, endurance produces character, character produces hope. And Michael is doing everything possible to keep hope alive,\u201d said Nadjibulla.\n\nKovrig is subjecting himself to a strict physical regimen, forever on the move in his small cell striving to walk the equivalent of five kilometres daily because he knows his mind cannot thrive if his body is not strong, said Nadjibulla.\n\nRobert Malley, Kovrig\u2019s boss at the International Crisis Group, says his imprisoned colleague can hold the plank, a core body exercise of endurance, for 18 minutes. In solidarity, Crisis Group colleagues recently had a plank competition but the closest anyone got was seven minutes. They\u2019re also walking 7,000 steps a day, the equivalent of five kilometres.\n\nMalley said he and his colleagues are in awe of Kovrig\u2019s discipline.\n\n\u201cNone of us can be prepared for that, unless you\u2019re in the military and you\u2019re told this could happen. But he seems to have had all of the reflexes, instincts that are necessary,\u201d said Malley.\n\nWhen Kovrig is released one day his colleagues hope stories of their attempts to replicate some of his exercises will help him heal and, perhaps, bridge the gap growing between them and him, said Malley.\n\nKovrig only found out the scope of the global pandemic during Barton\u2019s on-site virtual visit in October \u2014 his first contact with Canadian diplomats since January because Chinese authorities wouldn\u2019t allow any contact due to COVID-19, said Nadjibulla.\n\nHe was shocked at the pandemic\u2019s scale and compared it to a zombie apocalypse and the movie \u201cContagion.\u201d\n\nKovrig is also aware that he is one of \u201ctwo Michaels\u201d and understands that both he and Spavor \u201care caught in this bigger situation,\u201d she said. It\u2019s not a topic that can be discussed during the now-resumed 30-minute consular visits.\n\nNadjibulla said she was happy to hear that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to U.S. president-elect Joe Biden about the two Michaels in their recent conversation. Trudeau refused to discuss the content of that conversation last week, or whether Biden might revisit the Justice Department\u2019s attempted extradition and prosecution of Meng.\n\nIf the U.S. withdrew its charges, Meng could go free, and that might give China reason to free the two Michaels.\n\n\u201cOur Michael and Michael Spavor are caught in a bigger geopolitical struggle,\u201d Nadjibulla said. \u201cThey\u2019re pawns in a bigger political game involving the U.S., China and Canada. And they have been in the situation for two long years, for no other reason than being Canadian citizens.\u201d\n\nMike Blanchfield, The Canadian Press\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nWant to support local journalism during the pandemic?
