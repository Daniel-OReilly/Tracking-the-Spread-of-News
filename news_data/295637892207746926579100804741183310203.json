The initiative was part of its 2019-2022 RDKS Strategic Plan, which calls for improving awareness of the regional district\u2019s role and obtaining feedback from citizens.\n\nPeople can watch the board and committee meetings live at rdks.bc.ca/government/board/board_meeting_webcasts.\n\nThe economic development commission is set to meet at 1:00 p.m., the planning committee at 3:00 p.m. and the regular board meeting will begin at 7:00 p.m. on Dec. 11.\n\nPreviously, there was a space for a couple members of the public to attend meetings in-person. But following the latest COVID-19 public health restrictions, public attendance is no longer permitted.\n\nREAD MORE: Regional district sets date for Hazelton area zoning amendment engagement sessions\n\n@BenBogstie\n\nben.bogstie@terracestandard.com\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.",
