No vying for space on the water. And, if you have your own RV site or cabin right on the lake, no phoning in and competing with everyone else to try to reserve a spot.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to head to the lake, your hand-picked site will be waiting.\n\nBetter yet, when summer turns first to fall, then winter, you can be right back here, enjoying your four-season family getaway.\n\nSugar Lake Recreational Properties is a 66-lot shared interest lakefront development that boasts 45 fully serviced RV lots and 20 cabin sites.\n\nAt the new dock, just steps from your site, boat slips are available for lease. Through summer, guests are welcome to join you at the on-site lodge, where a licensed, full-service bistro is popular with both locals and guests.\n\nYour Sugar Lake home-away-from-home\n\nWhen life away from the lake beckons, explore the world on your doorstep: forests for hiking, freshwater lakes, rivers and streams for fishing, and the hills of Silver Star, just a 90-minute drive away, for summer mountain biking and winter skiing.\n\nTake your adventures on the road to take in the hot springs at Nakusp, and all manner of arts, activities and community activities in the village of Cherryville just 14km north.\n\nPeace of mind, now and tomorrow\n\nTo truly enjoy your recreational property, it must provide peace-of-mind \u2013 when you\u2019re there, but also when you\u2019re not.\n\nIn addition to year-round security and snow removal, the Sugar Lake management team also oversees property rentals if you choose to include your site in the rental pool \u2013 a great way to maximize your investment when you\u2019re not using it yourself. And if you ever change your mind, you can withdraw your property from the rental pool just as easily.\n\nUnderstanding that bank financing can be challenging for recreational properties, the development group \u2013 all local to the Okanagan \u2013 offer vendor financing for both the RV sites and cabins, meaning you can start making those sweet family memories as soon as this summer!\n\nExplore the possibilities sugarlakelife.ca or email info@sugarlakelife.ca\n\nBC LakesOkanaganOutdoors and Recreation",
