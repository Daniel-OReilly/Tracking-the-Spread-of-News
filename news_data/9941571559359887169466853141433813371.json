The program provides opportunities for Indigenous community members to participate in construction within their traditional territory for the purposes of observing, recording and reporting on implementation of construction activities to their communities.\n\nHarry Bodewitz, a program coordinator who is working closely with CMCL advisors from several Indigenous communities along the project corridor, has seen the value of the program.\n\n\u201cSomething might have been planned initially, but once we actually get to the field, that plan may change, or get modified, to make sure it\u2019s done right,\u201d said Bodewitz. \u201cIn the CMCL Program, we have an opportunity to observe what\u2019s going on, discuss it and share that with our communities.\u201d\n\nFor Mike Gouchie, a CMCL coordinator from Lheidli T\u2019enneh First Nation, the program provides a chance to be out in the field to make sure what matters to his community, and neighbouring community CMCL advisors, is at the forefront of the construction program.\n\n\u201cAs a CMCL coordinator, I\u2019m able to assist the CMCL advisors to be out in the field with inspectors, construction management and myself to visit sites of interest, to understand the scope of the project in our territories, and make sure environmental issues are identified,\u201d he said.\n\nTransparency is core to the CMCL program, with Indigenous communities meaningfully participating in the project to monitor construction activities, which is well underway.\n\nThis open, relationship-based approach is something that Coastal GasLink believes is integral to the success of the project.\n\nenergy sectornatural gas",
