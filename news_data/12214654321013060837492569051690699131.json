The Toronto Raptors are the only NBA team forced to play outside of their home market this season, but Ujiri says the club is doing everything it can to help players feel comfortable in Tampa. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris Young\n\nTheir practice facility is still under construction. The players and staff are on the hunt for temporary housing in Tampa.\n\nAs the NBA\u2019s only team playing outside of its market \u2014 and country \u2014 this season, the Toronto Raptors have numerous hurdles to clear.\n\nBut team president Masai Ujiri said if there\u2019s a unique trait about Toronto, it\u2019s his roster\u2019s ability to come together in the face of big challenges.\n\nHe expects nothing less in this bizarre campaign.\n\n\u201cListen, this is not an easy task here,\u201d Ujiri said on a Zoom video conference call Saturday. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of sacrifices to it. I know the whole world is sacrificing now and we are coming into a game and we\u2019re working at a job that we love.\n\n\u201cWhen we decide this is something that we are going to do, we all want to do it together. I\u2019m proud of this organization, honestly, to make this jump.\u201d\n\nThe Raptors begin team practices Sunday in Tampa, where they\u2019ll play their \u201chome\u201d games at Amalie Arena at least for part of the season due to Canada\u2019s travel restrictions around COVID-19.\n\nUjiri spoke to the media for nearly 40 minutes Saturday, touching on everything from free agency and front-office contracts, to keeping the Black Lives Matter momentum going, and the seventh anniversary of Nelson Mandela\u2019s death.\n\nThe Raptors learned less than three weeks ago they wouldn\u2019t be permitted to play out of Scotiabank Arena. The last-minute location change has meant rushing to build a practice court in a hotel ballroom, and finding the players and staff housing.\n\nReplicating the comforts of Toronto\u2019s OVO Centre practice facility won\u2019t be easy, but Ujiri said if the team\u2019s reaction to the bubble\u2019s ballroom courts during the NBA\u2019s summer restart is any indication, the team will adapt.\n\n\u201cI remember walking into the ballroom in the bubble almost the same time as Kyle (Lowry) and Fred (VanVleet). I\u2019ll never forget that image in my head. Right away they dribbled the ball and just got to it,\u201d Ujiri said. \u201cThese guys are hoopers. There was no complaint, there was nothing, all they wanted to do was play. That\u2019s how basketball players are, they see that hoop, they see that wooden floor and they just want to play.\u201d\n\nUjiri, who is with the team in Florida and was also in the Walt Disney World \u201cbubble\u201d after the resumption of play, said priority No. 1 is supporting the players and staff in relocating.\n\n\u201cAs the leader of the organization you try as hard as you can to make your staff, your players, everybody feel as comfortable as you can,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you always want to be in the environment that they are in too so that you are experiencing it with them.\u201d\n\nThe global pandemic will determine whether the Raptors will be home before the end of the season.\n\n\u201cWhether we are in Naples (Toronto\u2019s pre-bubble camp), whether we are in a bubble in Orlando, whether we\u2019re here, whether we\u2019re coming back, we play sports to win,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are going to have adversity \u2026 wherever we end up, home in Toronto, we love you guys there and we will do everything for you guys.\u201d\n\nWhether fans will be allowed at Amalie Arena for the 18 home games scheduled so far \u2014 the league has released only the first half of the season schedule \u2014 is still a question mark. Florida had over 10,000 new COVID-19 cases on Friday, and recently surpassed the one-million mark in total cases.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the process of working all these things (out), and I don\u2019t have definite answer for you, but the health and safety protocols are going to be important to us,\u201d said Ujiri, who thanked the Orlando Magic for allowing the Raptors to play within the same market.\n\nREAD MORE: \u2018I am one of yours forever,\u2019 departing Serge Ibaka tells Toronto Raptors fans\n\nUncertainty around where they\u2019d play pushed the renegotiation of staff contracts to the back-burner, but Ujiri said GM Bobby Webster\u2019s new contract is virtually a done deal.\n\nThere remains roster uncertainly around the future of Terence Davis, who faces seven charges, including assault and harassment after allegedly striking his girlfriend. Davis, who is with the team in Tampa, appears in court Dec. 11, a day before the Raptors tip off the pre-season at Charlotte.\n\nUjiri said the team must respect the process of the players\u2019 association and the league\u2019s investigation.\n\n\u201cWe made a decision as an organization with all the information we had with us. I will say this: We don\u2019t condone anything that resembles what was alleged to have happened \u2026 we\u2019ve done as much due diligence in talking to Terence, in talking to our organization,\u201d Ujiri said. \u201cWe went as far as even talking to all the women in our organization and getting their point of view.\u201d\n\nThe Raptors revamped their front court in free agency after losing Serge Ibaka and Marc Gasol. With so much riding on the 2021 off-season and free agency, Ujiri said that limited \u201cterm and years\u201d the Raptors could offer their former big men.\n\n\u201cMarc and Serge were incredible for our organization, and all of us have the same exact feelings about them,\u201d he said. \u201cHard to see, but sometimes we have to move on from these things.\u201d\n\nThe Raptors added Aron Baynes, a \u201cguy that you don\u2019t like on the other team and you love on your team,\u201d Ujiri said, and Alex Len to fill the void.\n\nThe NBA\u2019s developmental G League is also in limbo, and when \u2014 or if \u2014 it does tip off this season, Raptors 905, which runs out of Mississauga, Ont., faces the same travel restrictions as its parent club. That doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t figure out a way to play.\n\n\u201cI will say this, whatever the G League is doing, the Toronto Raptors and 905 will participate,\u201d Ujiri said.\n\nA CBC \u201ckid reporter\u201d posed the Zoom call\u2019s final question to Ujiri, asking how young fans can follow the team while they\u2019re not playing at Toronto\u2019s Scotiabank Arena.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here! We\u2019re on TV! You can see us \u2014 we\u2019re not going anywhere,\u201d Ujiri said the young reporter. \u201cWe\u2019re right here with you guys. And we\u2019ll be back. We\u2019ll be back soon enough. We\u2019re going to give it our all, we\u2019re going to try and play our best \u2026 this goes fast. A couple days ago we were in the bubble. We\u2019re right here now.\u201d\n\nLori Ewing, The Canadian Press\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nWant to support local journalism during the pandemic?
