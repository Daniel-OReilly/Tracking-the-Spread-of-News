Goody bags were put together by more than 25 volunteers from Halloween Fest, Rotary and the Interact Club.\n\n\u201cWe just want to make sure no one is left out and give them a little taste of Halloween,\u201d Bev Killbery Halloween Fest Committee director said.\n\n\u201cThis would have been our 33rd season for Halloween Fest,\u201d Kilberry said.\n\nHowever, this year to ensure that there was still some sweetness to go around, the committee arranged for the treat bags to be delivered through schools prior to Oct. 31, where teachers and staff will make plans for the disbursement, Killberry said.\n\nAll candy and bags have been put together using COVID-19 safety protocols.\n\nK-J Millar | Journalist\n\nemail\n\nLike the The Northern View on Facebook\n\nFollow us on Twitter Send K-JLike theonFollow us on",
