(AP Photo/John Raoux)\n\nNASA has named the 18 astronauts \u2014 half of them women \u2014 who will train for its Artemis moon-landing program.\n\nThe first woman and next man on the moon will come from this elite group.\n\nVice-President Mike Pence introduced the astronauts Wednesday at the close of his final meeting as chairman of the National Space Council. The announcement was made at Florida\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, beneath one of only three remaining Saturn V moon rockets from the 1960s and 1970s Apollo program.\n\nPence noted that the last of the 12 men to walk on the moon, the late Apollo 17 commander Gene Cernan, wanted nothing more than to remove \u201clast\u201d from his title. Cernan\u2019s final lunar footsteps were on Dec. 14, 1972.\n\n\u201cHe spent the rest of his natural life advocating for America to go back to the moon, and we are going to honour Gene Cernan\u2019s memory,\u201d Pence told the small crowd, seated several feet apart from one another.\n\nFive of the astronauts \u2014 the only ones in attendance \u2014 walked onto the stage, waving and wearing masks.\n\nNASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine stressed there would be more astronauts joining the group. NASA has 47 active astronauts.\n\nThe space agency is aiming for a moon landing by 2024, although the chances of that happening are growing increasingly dim. The upcoming change in administration also adds uncertainty.\n\nHalf of the NASA astronauts have spaceflight experience. Two are at the International Space Station right now: Kate Rubins and Victor Glover.\n\nThe two astronauts who performed the world\u2019s first all-female spacewalk last year made the cut: Christina Koch and Jessica Meir.\n\nIt\u2019s a fairly young group, with most in their 30s or 40s. The oldest is 55, the youngest 32. Only two \u2014 Joe Acaba and Stephanie Wilson \u2014 flew on NASA\u2019s old space shuttles.\n\nThe other experienced members on the list include Kjell Lindgren, Anne McClain and Scott Tingle, all former space station residents.\n\nAmong those yet to rocket into space: Kayla Barron, Raja Chari, Matthew Dominick, Woody Hoburg, Jonny Kim, Nicole Mann, Jasmin Moghbeli, Frank Rubio and Jessica Watkins.\n\nMarcia Dunn, The Associated Press\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nWant to support local journalism?
