The store has been serving Smithers for 70 years.\n\nFor 70 years, Hetherington and Hooper has been a cornerstone in Smithers, offering quality brands and friendly customer service at the corner of Main and 1st. The store evokes simpler times when businesses were family-run, with deep ties to local communities.\n\n\u201cOur customers are our friends,\u201d says co-owner Kelly Ehalt.\n\nShe and brother Mike Bovill proudly carry on the traditions passed down through three generations. Their late father Jack Bovill brought them up in the business, and shared everything he\u2019d learned working for Gordon Hetherington and Owen Hooper in the 1960s.\n\n\u201cSome of the families we serve in the Valley have been coming since Day 1. Our dad served those families, and we\u2019ve continued to do so,\u201d Ehalt says.\n\nClassic style for the modern age\n\nHetherington and Hooper serves customers from Prince George to Prince Rupert, and ships their unique stock to customers all over B.C.\n\nThe store carries both men\u2019s and ladies\u2019 wear, everything from work gear to suits, and serves an extensive clientele. European and North American tourists in town to hunt or fish will stop by the store to find clothing they can\u2019t find anywhere else. High school graduates and groomsmen rely on the store for fashionable suits, while others rely on the quality work gear Hetherington and Hooper provides.\n\n\u201cWe have customers who come to Smithers every year to visit, and will always stop in to say hello,\u201d Ehalt says. It\u2019s a long standing tradition, started by Gordon Hetherington and Owen Hooper.\n\nBond to Smithers\n\nEhalt and Bovill grew up in Smithers and their connection to the community runs deep. Hetherington and Hooper has a long history supporting community fundraisers, charities and clubs, and volunteering with the Smithers Merchants. The store is a caring presence in the community, not just a place of business.\n\n\u201cIt was important to our dad, and it\u2019s important to us,\u201d Ehalt says.\n\nThe siblings both enjoy the outdoors, and love the Smithers lifestyle. \u201cMost people are here because they want to be here, not because they have to be here.\u201d\n\nHetherington and Hooper is open Monday to Friday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Visit the store at the corner of Main Street and 1st or call 250-847-2455.
