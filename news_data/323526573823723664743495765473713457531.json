Reach out to Tricorp to find out how they can help you reach your next career goal!\n\nSome women want flowers on Feb. 14. Mary-Lou Starrett got something better.\n\n\u201cI got to go on-site and check out the construction cranes on Valentine\u2019s Day. I was surrounded by massive cranes \u2014 it was awesome!\u201d\n\nFor Starrett, visiting the modular construction site in Kitimat was the culmination of years of hard work, education, job hunting, and support from organizations like Tribal Resources Investment Corporation (TRICORP).\n\n\u201cA lot of people invested in me and my training. I\u2019m trying to do my best for them.\u201d\n\nBreaking barriers, facing fears\n\nMary Stroomer\u2019s big moment wasn\u2019t cranes in Kitimat, it was a pile of dirt in Maple Ridge. After years working as a flagger, Tricorp funded her Heavy Equipment Operator training with IUOE in Maple Ridge. She was keen to play with all the big toys, but driving an excavator up a steep pile and then digging the ground beneath her tracks was a little daunting.\n\n\u201cI pushed myself to try new things in Maple Ridge. You need to be a sponge \u2014 watch and learn from those who already know,\u201d she says.\n\nWhen she made it to the top she let out a little whoop on the radio, and then got right back to work.\n\n\u201cFor years I stood on the outside looking in. I\u2019d rather be on the inside.\u201d\n\nNever stop training\n\nStarrett trained to become a Heavy Equipment Operator in 2014, but still found it hard to get a job.\n\n\u201cI thought that would open doors, but nobody wants to hire someone who\u2019s green and doesn\u2019t have the hours.\u201d\n\nAfter three years handing out resumes, Tricorp helped Starrett re-take the Heavy Equipment Operator course, just to get more hours behind the wheel. Then she got her Class 3 driver\u2019s license, and then her Class 1.\n\n\u201cWithin a week I was working. I listened to CFNR a lot while driving the highways, and I kept on hearing these Tricorp ads for crane operators. I was interested but thought it was hard to get into. But Tricorp funded me again!\n\nNow she\u2019s working down her industry hours so she can get back to the cranes at the Kitimat modular construction project.\n\n\u201cI want to see it grow. I want to be a part of it,\u201d Starrett says.\n\nGet involved\n\nStroomer also found employers didn\u2019t take her resume seriously, so when she saw a Facebook ad for Tricorp\u2019s W.E.S.T. Training she threw her hat in the ring. That training qualified her for the Heavy Equipment Operator training in Maple Ridge, which led to her dream job with Bird Construction.\n\n\u201cBird is an awesome company. They\u2019re all about safety. If you have a problem the supervisors are there to help \u2014 nobody\u2019s giving me the gears because I\u2019m new.\u201d\n\nStroomer and Starrett both recently earned their Heavy Equipment Operator journeyman tickets, and are hoping more women join them in the field.\n\n\u201cNow\u2019s the time to do it with Kitimat hiring apprentices. Get your foot in the door!\u201d Stroomer says.\n\ndevelopmentIndigenous",
