Several Indigenous groups are lambasting ABC\u2019s \u201cBig Sky\u201d for a storyline about murdered women in Montana that fails to mention the crisis disproportionately involves Indigenous victims. (Sergei Bachlakov, ABC)\n\nIndigenous critics of ABC\u2019s kidnapping drama \u201cBig Sky\u201d say it fails to acknowledge real-life missing and murdered Indigenous women and are extending their grievance to CTV for airing the series in Canada without added context.\n\nThe Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs is among several Indigenous groups lambasting the Vancouver-shot series for a storyline about kidnapped women in Montana that skirts a real-life epidemic in that state, as well as B.C.\n\nThe B.C. group\u2019s secretary-treasurer Kukpi7 (pronounced COOK\u2019pee) Judy Wilson called it \u201cimperative\u201d that \u201cABC demonstrate some awareness and cultural competency\u201d regarding systemic violence against Indigenous women and girls.\n\nBut she took issue Thursday with CTV, too, saying \u201cthey are equally responsible\u201d for airing a series that appears to discount a painful reality that extends to Canada.\n\nHer union has joined several other Indigenous groups in asking ABC to append an information card to the end of future episodes that explains the MMIWG crisis.\n\nIf ABC won\u2019t do it, Wilson said she\u2019d like to see CTV do it themselves.\n\n\u201cAnyone in the film industry and in the broadcast industry in Canada \u2014 especially with the National Inquiry (into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls) \u2014 should have a social conscious if not a moral conscious and obligation to include this kind of information in their productions or at least an info card at the (end),\u201d Wilson said when reached by phone near Vernon, B.C.\n\n\u201cBy omitting it and by not including any references \u2026 they\u2019re adding to the issue of the genocide against Indigenous women and girls.\u201d\n\nCTV did not provide comment by mid-afternoon Thursday.\n\nSimilar complaints against ABC have been raised by the Great Plains Tribal Chairmen\u2019s Association representing members of tribes in North Dakota, South Dakota and Nebraska; and the Rocky Mountain Tribal Leaders Council, which represents Montana\u2019s eight federally recognized tribes; and the international Global Indigenous Council, which said it\u2019s not asking the network to pull or reshoot the series, but to insert an information card.\n\n\u201cBig Sky\u201d premiered Nov. 17 on ABC and CTV with Canadian stars Katheryn Winnick and Kylie Bunbury alongside Ryan Phillippe as detectives on the hunt for two sisters kidnapped on a remote Montana highway.\n\nIt\u2019s based on C.J. Box\u2019s novel \u201cThe Highway,\u201d which the critics say also failed to address the disproportionate number of Indigenous missing and murdered women in Montana.\n\nWhile much MMIWG advocacy has been directed towards politicians and the justice system, Wilson said the entertainment industry must also address the way it portrays Indigenous issues. She said there are many Indigenous organizations willing to help film and television productions tackle these concerns responsibly.\n\n\u201cA lot of it is social media or the messages that go to a lot of people on how we treat Indigenous women and girls, and social media can be a change-agent in what\u2019s happening out there,\u201d said Wilson.\n\n\u201cWe need to stand in the truth and we need to talk the truth and we need to experience it so we can move forward and find solutions that are truth-based.\u201d\n\nThe Canadian Press\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nWant to support local journalism?
