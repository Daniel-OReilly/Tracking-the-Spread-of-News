In a matter of hours, we had 50 volunteers signed up and have another 30 on the waiting list.\u201d\n\nKat Webster signed up to adopt a senior and she said her family is thrilled to help out.\n\n\u201cWe chose to participate to help spread some Christmas cheer and love to our seniors that have had such a tough last year,\u201d she said. \u201cI work as a registered nurse and I am aware of how challenging this last few months have been for everyone, however it has been particularly lonely and isolating for our seniors. We hope that the seniors that receive a little something from us feel connection, community, cared for and a little less lonely.\u201d\n\nErin Colebank was also one of the lucky people to get a spot to sponsor a senior and she said she and her husband wanted to do something to help somebody out this holiday season.\n\n\u201cKnowing how isolated and lonely seniors in our community are likely feeling, especially this year due to COVID, when I saw the post I thought it was the perfect place to help out,\u201d she said. \u201cTo know that we are helping to make somebody\u2019s holiday a little brighter is really a special feeling. I think the program is a fantastic idea and I hope that it is something that continues on year after year.\u201d\n\nAnyone who knows a senior that would like to particpate, can call Lauren at 250-877-3269.\n\nMore information can found on WellSpring\u2019s Facebook page.\n\nChristmas",
