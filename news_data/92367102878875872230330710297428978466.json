He immediately checked the numbers on the ticket he got from Shoppers Drug Mart on Main Street in the BCLC Lotto! app.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cI think I was still half asleep and had to ask my partner what she saw on the screen to confirm the win.\u201d\n\nEtzerza immediately shared the news with his mom, who was in as much shock as him.\n\n\u201cI have teased my mom that I would win, so when she realized I wasn\u2019t joking, she was happy for me,\u201d he said.\n\nEtzerza, who has been a car collector for many years, but recently sold his collection said he plans start a new collection and use his unexpected prize to start a new business.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing feeling and overwhelming at the same time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be a winner.\u201d\n\nNobody won the jackpot of an estimated $6 million jackpot on Nov. 25 or in any of the draws since. Saturday night\u2019s jackpot is now up to an estimated $20 million.\n\nThe 6/49 is a nationwide lottery in which participants select six numbers for a chance to win a jackpot that starts at $5 million and steadily grows. Each ticket purchased also includes a 10-digit number that is automatically entered to win the guaranteed $1 million prize.\n\nREAD MORE: Ken and Susan Salter of Telkwa win $20 million\n\n\n\ndeb.meissner@interior-news.com\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter",
