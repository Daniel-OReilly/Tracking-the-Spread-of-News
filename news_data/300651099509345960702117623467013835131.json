A total of 36 people entered, 14 of whom received prizes.\n\nBike to Work Week was started in 1995 in the Greater Victoria area with a core group of committed bicycle commuters. It reached a peak last year with 56,074 participants cycling 2,96 million kilometres.\n\nThis year saw a drastic reduction in numbers with just 12,713 cyclists biking 630, 550 kilometres.\n\nThe Smithers Chamber of Commerce, which sponsored the event locally, was neverthless pleased with local turnout.\n\n\n\nSign up here Get local stories you won't find anywhere else right to your inbox.\n\nNoa was one of the winners of a local prize during Bike to Work Week at Town Hall.
