(ABC via AP)\n\nTaylor Swift won her third consecutive artist of the year prize at the American Music Awards, but she missed the show for a good reason: She said she\u2019s busy re-recording her early music after her catalogue was sold.\n\nIn a video that aired during Sunday\u2019s awards show, the pop star said \u201cthe reason I\u2019m not there tonight is I\u2019m actually re-recording all of my old music in the studio where we originally recorded it. So it\u2019s been amazing. And I can\u2019t wait for you to hear it.\u201d\n\nLast year music manager Scooter Braun \u2014 who manages Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande \u2014 announced that his Ithaca Holdings company had acquired Big Machine Label Group, the home to Swift\u2019s first six albums. This month Braun said he has sold the master rights to Swift\u2019s first six albums to an investment company; Swift acknowledged the sale on social media and said she would not work with the new buyers because Braun was still involved.\n\nInstead, she headed back to the studio.\n\nAre you ready for it? @taylorswift13 is #AMAs Artist of the Year! pic.twitter.com/3pcbLKSE6B \u2014 American Music Awards (@AMAs) November 23, 2020\n\nSwift beat out Bieber, Post Malone and Roddy Ricch to win the top award. She also won favourite music video and favourite pop/rock female artist, winning three honours and tying Bieber, Dan + Shay and the Weeknd for most wins Sunday.\n\nThe Weeknd lost artist of the year, but he still kicked off his all-star week as a big winner: Days before he\u2019s expected to land multiple Grammy nominations, he won favourite soul/R&B male artist, favourite soul/R&B album for \u201cAfter Hours\u201d and favourite soul/R&B song for \u201cHeartless\u201d two days before the 2021 Grammy nominations are announced.\n\n\u201cThe last time I received this award it was given to me by the late, great Prince,\u201d he said after winning favourite soul/R&B album. \u201cAnd, you know, he\u2019s the reason I get to constantly challenge the genre of R&B and yeah, I\u2019d like to dedicate this to him.\u201d\n\nThe Weeknd didn\u2019t break character throughout the three-hour show with his gauze-wrapped face, which matched the vibe of his recent album and music videos where he appears blooded and bruised. He accepted his awards and performed with his face wrapped in gauze.\n\nKenny G joined the Weeknd for his performance, playing the sax in downtown Los Angeles as the Weeknd walked across a bridge singing \u201cIn Your Eyes.\u201d He finished the performance singing \u201cSave Your Tears.\u201d\n\nThe Weeknd was one of several artists who appeared live at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles for the fan-voted awards show. Others recently taped their performances because of the coronavirus pandemic, though host Taraji P. Henson \u2014 who appeared live from the venue \u2014 said the few audience members sitting in the mezzanine practiced social distancing, wore masks and were tested for the virus.\n\nHenson joked that A-list celebrities were in the audience, including Beyonc\u00e9, though cardboard cut-out of the singer, Jay-Z and other stars appeared in seats.\n\nBut a good number of chart-toppers were in the building. Breakthrough singer-rapper Doja Cat performed and won new artist of the year and favourite soul/R&B female artist. Grammy-winning country duo Dan + Shay beautifully performed \u201cI Should Probably Go to Bed\u201d and won favourite country duo or group, collaboration of the year and favourite country song for \u201c10,000 Hours,\u201d the latter two shared with Bieber. And Megan Thee Stallion \u2014 won favourite rap/hip-hop songs for \u201cWAP\u201d with Cardi B \u2014 performed \u201cBody\u201d from her recently released debut album \u201cGood News.\u201d\n\nBieber and Shawn Mendes kicked off the AMAs with a pre-taped performance of their new duet \u201cMonster,\u201d marking the first time they performed the song together. It began with a stripped-down Bieber singing his recent hit \u201cLonely,\u201d with songwriter-producer Benny Blanco on piano, and \u201cHoly,\u201d where background dancers wearing masks joined him.\n\nMendes, strumming his guitar, then appeared for \u201cMonster,\u201d which featured the twentysomethings singing lyrics about about fame and growing up as celebrities who attracted massive public attention. Mendes later sang his song \u201cWonder\u201d during the show, which aired on ABC.\n\nKaty Perry, in her first performance since giving birth to her first child, gave a strong performance of the emotional and hopeful song \u201cOnly Love,\u201d which featured a surprise guest appearance from Darius Rucker, who sang and played guitar. With flaming red lights glaring behind her, Billie Eilish sang her new song \u201cTherefore I Am,\u201d as her brother-songwriter-producer Finneas backed her on guitar. Jennifer Lopez and Maluma teamed up to perform their new songs \u201cPa\u2019 Ti\u201d and \u201cLonely\u201d from the film \u201cMarry Me,\u201d which both of them star in, while Dua Lipa \u2014 who won favourite pop/rock song \u2014 floated in the air during her performance of \u201cLevitating.\u201d\n\n24kGoldn and Iann Dior \u2014 who currently have the country\u2019s No. 1 song with the smash hit \u201cMood,\u201d also performed. The multi-genre track is the rare song that has reached No. 1 on both the rap and rock charts.\n\nOther performers included BTS, Lewis Capaldi, Machine Gun Kelly, Lil Baby, Bell Biv DeVoe and Nelly, who performed hits from his diamond-certified debut album \u201cCountry Grammar,\u201d which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year.\n\nThis year the AMAs, which typically awards one Latin honour, launched more categories in the genre. Becky G \u2014 who burst on the music scene in 2014 with the pop hit \u201cShower\u201d but has recently had success singing in Spanish and launching hits on the Latin charts \u2014 won favourite Latin female artist.\n\nShe used her speech to honour immigrant families.\n\n\u201cI proudly wave both flags, Mexican and American. And like many, many children and grandchildren of immigrants, no matter where they\u2019re from, we have learned from the ones before us what sacrifice and hard work looks like,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I dedicate this award to all of our immigrant workers in this pandemic; the students and immigrant families. It\u2019s because of my family, my abuelitos, that I stand here today.\u201d\n\nNominees for the AMAs were based on streaming, album and digital sales, radio airplay and social activity, and reflect the time period of Sept. 27, 2019, through Sept. 24, 2020.\n\nMesfin Fekadu, The Associated Press\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nWant to support local journalism during the pandemic?
