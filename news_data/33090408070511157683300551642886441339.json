(Thom Barker photo)\n\nThe 21st annual Santa\u2019s Breakfast was cancelled amid COVID- 19 health concerns, leaving the recipient of the charity event scrambling.\n\nThe event is always held at the Prestige Hudson Bay Lodge in Smithers and people stop in for a breakfast, see Santa, listen to local music and make a donation of food or money to The Bulkley Valley Salvation Army.\n\nLast year, almost 10,000 pounds of food was donated to the food bank.\n\nCommunity family services coordinator for the Bulkley Valley Kelly Spurway said it helps them through the winter months.\n\nShe added demand for their services has gone up since the pandemic hit earlier this year by about 34 per cent. That percentage doesn\u2019t include the increase they\u2019ve seen for their kids lunch program.\n\nThey have also been delivering more food hampers to Witset lately.\n\nHowever, this year another event that brings in donations will be expanded to hopefully help fill some of the need.\n\n\u201cWe are very lucky this year, the first responders have partnered with us for Stuff the Truck. So now there will be Stuff the Truck at all three grocery stores instead of one,\u201d said Spurway. \u201cWe are hoping with that we will bring in more food than normal to help replace the food that we would normally receive during Santa\u2019s breakfast. We know it won\u2019t be the same amount but every little bit helps.\u201d\n\nShe knows it won\u2019t be the same but nothing has really been the same since the coronavirus crept into the country.\n\n\u201cSeeing the local musicians like the fiddlers, and Sweet Harmony at the breakfast will be missed,\u201d she added. \u201cJust getting together to see each other and celebrate, it was a pretty hard decision. [to cancel]\u201d\n\nStuff the Truck will take place outside of Safeway, No Frills and BV Wholesale on Dec. 11 from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThere is a wish list for their top 15 in demand items at the food bank.\n\n\u201cA lot of people like donating produce at Christmas time but we are asking people to donate a gift card instead so we can buy as we need,\u201d added Spurway.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to provide lunch meat, bread, apples in our kids hamper program every week, instead of delivering the lunches to the school daily. So the kids are making their own lunches at home now. We are so busy right now, we can\u2019t physically do it, we\u2019d be at work 12 hours a day and it has a lot to do with COVID, not trying to touch the kids food.\u201d\n\nThe Salvation Army\u2019s Kettle Campaign is also in full swing.\n\n\u201cLiving in the Bulkley Valley is the most generous community I\u2019ve lived in,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we think we are going to run out of everything, we suddenly have a bountiful of what we need. That is this community. If you saw you need something, we end up with it. I thank everyone for that.\u201d",
