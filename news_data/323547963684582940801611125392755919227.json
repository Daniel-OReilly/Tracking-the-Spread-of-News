In BC, there\u2019s approximately $160 million in unclaimed funds sitting in long-forgotten accounts waiting to be collected!\n\nThese forgotten assets are administered by a non-profit called the BC Unclaimed Property Society (BCUPS) (www.unclaimedpropertybc.ca), which as a public service oversees long-lost money in dormant accounts and works to reunite these funds with the rightful owners.\n\n\u201cThe\n\nBC Unclaimed Property Society serves as kind of a lost-and-found for forgotten funds in the province,\u201d says Alena Levitz, Executive Director of BCUPS.\n\nIn 2018, BCUPS returned approximately $1.7 million in unclaimed funds.\n\nSince it was established by the provincial government and Vancouver Foundation in 2003, the Society has put approximately $14.5 million in forgotten funds back in the hands of British Columbians.\n\nFunds are from dormant credit union accounts, unclaimed wages, insurance payments, court payments, intestate estates (death without a will), overpayments to debt collectors, and outstanding real estate deposits.\n\n\u201cFunds become dormant for a host of reasons,\u201d points out Levitz. \u201cIf you\u2019ve moved around a lot, chances are you\u2019ve become separated from some money that belongs to you. You could have left some funds in a credit union account you forgot to close. Another common scenario is when an employee leaves a place of employment, moves away and the employer can\u2019t locate them to give them their final pay.\u201d\n\nSearching for missing funds is simple and free\n\nIf you think you have forgotten funds, search BCUPS\u2019 free online database to see if there\u2019s missing money waiting for you. Individuals can retrieve forgotten funds by completing a simple verification process that firmly establishes their identity as rightful owner. There are no fees or costs to search for or claim dormant assets through BCUPS.\n\nIn today\u2019s era of online scams and online phishing, Levitz says people have every right to be cautious. \u201cBCUPS never asks for expenses, taxes, fees or some other disbursements to claim forgotten funds, \u201d she says.\n\nShe encourages consumers to be wary of anyone alleging to hold unclaimed property who pressures them to act fast before it expires or asks for banking or credit card information. \u201cWe take extraordinary measures to protect people\u2019s privacy when reuniting them with their unclaimed funds.\u201d She also points out that there is no limitation period to claim forgotten funds from BCUPS.\n\nWhile the average BCUPS claim is around $300 to $500, somewhere in BC is the heir to an unclaimed estate worth a whopping $1.9 million.\n\nNow that would cover a lot of holiday bills!",
