    "content": "The protocol follows recent recommendations of the Provincial Medical Health Officer\n\nStarting on Monday (Nov. 16), the District of Kitimat (DOK) is strongly encouraging face masks to be worn in all public, indoor DOK facilities to help reduce the potential for spread of COVID-19.\n\nMasks are optional while participating in indoor sports, ice skating, and fitness centre and weight room physical activities, the DOK said, and are not to be worn while swimming or participating in aquatic activities.\n\nHowever, those participating in the exempt or optional physical activities are still asked to wear a mask while travelling to and from the activity area. Children five years old and under, as well as those who have a medical condition that prevents them from wearing a face mask or covering are exempt from this new protocol, the DOK said.\n\nOrganizations and groups that have included masks are part of their safe return to play plans are asked to continue with those plans going forward.\n\nThe DOK said this enhancement to its COVID-19 safety protocols follows recent recommendations of the Provincial Medical Health Officer around mask use in indoor public spaces.\n\nFor more information, contact the district at 250-632-8900.\n\n\n\nclare.rayment@northernsentinel.com\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter",
