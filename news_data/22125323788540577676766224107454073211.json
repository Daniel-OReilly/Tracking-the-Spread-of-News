    "content": "For those who aren\u2019t aware, back in June/early-July 2020, Merriam-Webster dictionary officially defined the word \u201cirregardless.\u201d\n\n\u201cIrregardless\u201d means the exact same thing as \u201cregardless,\u201d which means \u2018despite everything else\u2019 when used as an adverb and \u2018careless\u2019 or \u2018heedless\u2019 when used as an adjective. However, many people use \u2018irregardless\u2019 instead of \u2018regardless,\u2019 despite the former not technically being an actual word prior to this summer.\n\nIt\u2019s a word that many people have many qualms with, as the \u2018ir\u2019 at the beginning doesn\u2019t actually add anything or change the word\u2019s meaning in any way. Merriam-Webster decided to officially define it because \u201cit has been in use for well over 200 years, employed by a large number of people across a wide geographic range and with a consistent meaning,\u201d they wrote on their website.\n\nHowever, the many articles written about it showed that the employees who had to define the word were not happy to be including it in the official dictionary and decided to be mildly petty about it. Because of that, the official dictionary definition of \u2018irregardless\u2019 is simply \u201cregardless.\u201d\n\nAs someone who writes for a living, in English, in particular, I often find myself conflicted with some words and whether or not they should be included in the dictionary. On one hand, yes, they\u2019ve been used for centuries, but on the other hand, just because they\u2019ve been used for a long time, does that mean they\u2019re actually right? And right enough to be included in the dictionary?\n\nTo me, \u2018irregardless\u2019 feels like just another eggcorn \u2014 a word or phrase that results from mishearing or misinterpreting another word or phrase (e.g. nip it in the \u2018butt\u2019 instead of nip it in the \u2018bud\u2019).\n\nNow, because it\u2019s a dictionary-defined word, I\u2019m not going to complain about it for too long because there\u2019s nothing really I can do. It\u2019s not a word I\u2019d ever use myself, but I\u2019ll try my best to not make a huge deal out of it.\n\nI do love the English language and all its complexities, though.\n\nI\u2019m not very good at math. I did well in math classes at school, but try to get me to add, divide, or figure out percentages at a moment\u2019s notice and my brain completely freezes up. But for some people, math comes easy to them. Get them to multiply two large numbers at the drop of a hat and within a few seconds they can give you the correct answer.\n\nMy brain definitely doesn\u2019t work like that, which is why I love English and words and grammar so much. That\u2019s something my brain actually understands, for one reason or another. English, History, writing papers, articles, stories, you name it. I love the diversity and openness of writing, even if it means accepting words like \u2018irregardless.\u2019\n\nEnglish is a tricky language, that\u2019s for sure. Spelling, grammar, proper sentences are all key parts of the language, all of which have changed and adapted as language and society did. Text lingo such as \u201cLOL\u201d (laughing out loud) and \u201cluv\u201d (instead of \u2018love\u2019) have also been added to the dictionary in past years, marking them as an official part of the English language.\n\nBut regardless of the fact that I love to laugh out loud \u2014 and likely use many of these words while I\u2019m texting \u2014 don\u2019t expect to see too many nonstandard or texting words or eggcorns from me in the paper anytime soon. That\u2019s something I\u2019ll make sure I\u2019m nipping in the butt!\n\n\u2014 Clare Rayment, Kitimat Northern Sentinel editor",
