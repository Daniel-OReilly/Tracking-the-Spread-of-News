    "content": "Coastal GasLink kicked off its summer construction program in July and is safely putting people back to work, providing well-paying jobs that support local families as part of British Columbia\u2019s healthy economic recovery.\n\nAs construction activities safely grow, so will our workforce, with approximately 1,700 people expected to be working across the route by the end of July. With pipe stringing, welding and installation planned to begin in August, more jobs and opportunities will be added regularly.\n\n\u201cIt would really be an eye-opener to people to see the amount of jobs that are created in the local communities,\u201d said Mat Seguin, a Project Coordinator with Surespan Construction Ltd, who\u2019s working on the project today.\n\nMore than just a number, the employment opportunities are one of the ways Coastal GasLink is proud to support a healthy economic recovery for communities in the north. \u201cIt\u2019s really the people on the ground, who are employed, feeding their families, buying clothing for their kids. They\u2019re being part of the economy, they can make money again and build a good life,\u201d said Derek Orr, SA Energy Group\u2019s Indigenous and Community Relations Manager.\n\nTo help equip local Indigenous workers with the skills and certifications they need to be part of the project this summer, Coastal GasLink, together with one of its prime contractors, recently welcomed 12 trainees as part of the inaugural session of the Pathways to Prosperity Program. The dedicated \u2018training-to-employment\u2019 program was held at the newly-opened Vanderhoof Lodge, where participants received specialized training to kick start a long-lasting career in construction.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that the pandemic has created challenges and uncertainties for communities small and large across the north. That\u2019s why we\u2019re proud to be able to help people get safely back to work this summer, through the many fields and careers that our project touches,\u201d said Kiel Giddens, Coastal GasLink\u2019s Public Affairs Manager in Prince George.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s as a labourer, medic, or construction monitor, Coastal GasLink offers the opportunity to safely train and employ workers to benefit them today, and provide skills and experience that can last a lifetime,\u201d explained Giddens.\n\nAs always, the health and safety of our workforce, their families, and surrounding communities is at the forefront of everything we do. As we move into summer construction and peak activities, Coastal GasLink has implemented enhanced project-wide health and safety standards at all worksites and workforce accommodations in accordance with Dr. Bonnie Henry\u2019s guidance.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we want our team to go home knowing their families are safe and that they can continue to provide for them,\u201d added Giddens.\n\nLearn more about Coastal GasLink\u2019s summer construction schedule, as well as construction activities and job opportunities in your community, by visiting CoastalGasLink.com.\n\nnatural gas",
