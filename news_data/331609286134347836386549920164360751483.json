U.K. health authorities rolled out the first doses of a widely tested and independently reviewed COVID-19 vaccine Tuesday, starting a global immunization program that is expected to gain momentum as more serums win approval. (AP Photo/Frank Augstein, Pool)\n\nThe news of Canada approving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine came with a sigh of relief for many, a glimmer of hope in a nearly year-long pandemic that has left more than 13,000 dead across the country.\n\nPeople in the U.K. have already begun to get inoculated with the vaccine, which Pfizer said is 95 per cent effective after two doses, given three weeks apart.\n\nBut as Health Canada chief medical adviser Dr. Supriya Sharma said, \u201ceven the best vaccine is only effective if people trust it and take it.\u201d\n\nHeidi Tworek, an associate professor at the University of B.C. School of Public Policy and Global Affairs, agreed, but said the work needs to start now.\n\n\u201cIf officials are in the position of trying to combat weird information that\u2019s floating around, you\u2019re already in a losing position,\u201d Tworek.\n\n\u201cWhat you really want to be doing is setting your own frame of what this vaccine is doing. It does require a substantial communication effort that goes beyond press conferences.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Health Canada authorizes use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine\n\nWhat\u2019s key, Tworek said, is not to dismiss concerns outright and to try and engage people on an individual level, whether they are newly concerned or long-time skeptics. It\u2019s also important to keep in mind, she noted, that typical anti-vaccine groups are usually filled with parents, since most vaccines are targeted at children. The COVID vaccines, however, will be targeted at adults for a long time before they may become available to kids.\n\n\u201cWe find that people have many, many reasons [to be skeptical of vaccines]. They have half-heard something, they\u2019re worried because of other vaccines, they themselves have had an adverse reaction to a vaccine. It can really span the whole gamut.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: UK probing if allergic reactions linked to Pfizer vaccine\n\nThere are also many in Canada, especially Indigenous and racialized Canadians, who are worried about how they are treated by the health care system as a whole.\n\n\u201c[This is] a group of people who have really legitimate concerns based on tragically recent experiences that causes them to be very skeptical,\u201d Tworek said. She added that apologies and investigations into cases like the death of Joyce Echaquan in a Quebec hospital, and allegations of a blood alcohol guess game at a B.C. hospital, can help show that authorities are taking racism in health care seriously.\n\n\u201cPeople can feel that there are actually steps forward, you have an acknowledgement of what has been their lived experience and there is a commitment to change.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also important to learn from the introduction of masks and other COVID measures, which have faced some opposition. Tworek said there\u2019s lesson to take away from more successful jurisdictions.\n\n\u201cThe most effective places from the very beginning used social media\u2026 they tried to meet people where they were by being on as many channels as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cIn New Zealand, [Prime Minister] Jacinda Ardern would do \u2018Conversations through COVID\u2019 where she would invite guests from a wide variety of professions and interests to talk to her about COVID, so it was a two-way conversation.\u201d\n\nVisuals or graphics, rather than science-heavy language, can make information more accessible to people who \u201creally have never needed to know about these scientific processes but might want that kind of information in ways that might make sense to them.\u201d\n\nCommon worries about vaccines, and how to dispel them:\n\n1. Watching science happen in real time\n\nOne part of the conversation she feels hasn\u2019t been handle well is explaining to the public how science works in real time. Tworek dubbed this the \u201cscience meta narrative, which is that when you tell people your advice, [you\u2019re] also explaining to them how it was arrived at and what they might expect.\u201d\n\nIn B.C. and Canada, shifting recommendations, sometimes delayed or without notice or explanation, led to confusion. Changing guidelines, Tworek said, should have been positioned as a sign of strength as the scientific community learned more about what was a new diseases.\n\n2. How quickly vaccines were approved\n\n\u201cHelp people understand why was it so quick,\u201d Tworek said, whether it\u2019s explaining that vaccine phases that usually run one after the other were done at the same time for COVID vaccines, or that manufacturing was done the same time as the clinical trial, instead of afterwards.\n\n3. Adverse reactions\n\nExplaining, rather than brushing off, adverse reactions to vaccines is more helpful. Tworek said that people can be rightfully worried about allergic reactions, especially serious ones, but it\u2019s important to put it into context.\n\n\u201cWhen you vaccine 35 million people, what is a 0.00001 per cent? It\u2019s people, it\u2019s humans. So you need to figure out how to convey the risks around that,\u201d she said. A helpful comparison can be allergies to other things, whether medicines like penicillin or foods like nuts.\n\n4. Be kind, don\u2019t ridicule\n\nWhile it may be easy to make assumptions, Tworek said it\u2019s important to listen and address concerns seriously.\n\n\u201cTry to respond to them\u2026 with empathy, so you don\u2019t end up unintentionally hardening people\u2019s hesitancy into an anti-vaxx stance,\u201d she said.\n\n5. Start before vaccines are widely available\n\n\u201cWe should have started working some time ago, but we really need to start working to make sure that people understand if there are any risks, and we try to address vaccine hesitancy now, even though it will be months before many of those people would be eligible to get a vaccine,\u201d Tworek said. The last thing health officials will want is vaccines sitting in storage while they try to figure out how to get people to take them.\n\nREAD MORE: \u2018Route out\u2019 of pandemic: 90-year-old woman receives UK\u2019s 1st COVID-19 vaccine dose\n\n@katslepian\n\nkatya.slepian@bpdigital.ca\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nWant to support local journalism during the pandemic?
