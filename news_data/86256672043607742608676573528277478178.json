(Brittany Gervais/Terrace Standard)\n\nSuwilaawks Community School will be closed Friday, Dec. 11 and Monday, Dec. 14 due to staffing shortages, according to a Dec. 10 Coast Mountains School District 82 (CMSD82) media release.\n\n\u201cFor clarification, this temporary school closure is not a COVID-19 closure,\u201d said Janet Meyer, superintendent, in the release. \u201cThat directive can only be authorized by Northern Health authority and Ministry of Education. This is a closure due to staffing shortages.\u201d\n\nThe school will reopen on Tuesday, Dec. 15. The release states that the closure is operational in nature and that school administration was working with families to \u201censure students\u2019 continued learning opportunities.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt present the imbalance of regular school staff and employees, who are not as familiar with school routines and students, is problematic when attempting to ensure safety,\u201d Meyer said in the release.\n\nIn a Dec. 10 interview with the Terrace Standard before the closure was announced, Meyer said that the school district was dealing with a shortage of teachers and that CMSD82 was \u201crelying very heavily\u201d on temporary teachers on-call, or TTOC\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve enacted an emergency plan where by when we run out of TTOC\u2019s individuals such as myself and the staff here at the board office are going into schools and that\u2019s where I was this morning, covering a class,\u201d she said.\n\nREAD MORE: Additional COVID-19 exposure detected at Caledonia Secondary School in Terrace\n\n@BenBogstie\n\nben.bogstie@terracestandard.com\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.",
