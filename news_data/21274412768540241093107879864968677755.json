    "content": "Why does the after-work darkness affect you so much more as an adult than as a child?\n\nThis might be a controversial opinion, but I\u2019m not a huge fan of standard time.\n\nDaylight savings time runs from March to November, then we switch back to standard time to get more hours of daylight in the morning during the winter.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019d happily stay in daylight savings time. It\u2019s still dark at the time I wake up for work (however I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s because it\u2019s actually dark or simply because it\u2019s usually cloudy in Kitimat. I will experiment with this on the next sunny day we get), and I would much rather go home when it\u2019s still somewhat light out.\n\nGoing home at dusk or when it\u2019s already dark makes it feel like the day is over. There\u2019s no fun, after-work activities in the daylight to look forward to. You can obviously still go out and do things, but it makes it more tiring trying to function when it\u2019s dark and your body thinks it should be in bed.\n\nTo be fair, it\u2019s 4 p.m. now as I write this, and it\u2019s already getting dark, so maybe I wouldn\u2019t feel any different if we stayed in daylight time. Who\u2019s to say?\n\nIn Fall 2019 and early 2020, the provincial government in B.C., for those who don\u2019t remember, was actually discussing and planning on staying on permanent daylight time. Most people, however, sleep researchers included, deduced that it would actually be better to stay on permanent standard time, for sleep patterns, daily movement, and general proper body and brain functioning. (You\u2019d have to read the studies on this for more information, I don\u2019t think I could sum it up properly here.)\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the childhood memories of playing with friends after school, or just feeling like you still had your whole evening ahead of you after doing homework and chores, but having at least a couple of hours of daylight after leaving work or school or whatever you were doing made the day feel so much longer and just full of opportunity.\n\nI\u2019m finding, as an adult, that the darkness tires me out even more than it used to. I get home and immediately I\u2019m ready to go to my bed to read, watch TV, or honestly even go straight to sleep. That might just be because adults have less energy than children, but going home from work in darkness definitely doesn\u2019t help.\n\nAnd as I say all this, the thought occurs to me: maybe it\u2019s not the darkness that affects me, maybe it\u2019s the growing up.\n\nAs a child, everything seems big and bright and magical. The darkness may be a little darker (and full of monsters), but the light is often one thousand times brighter.\n\nComing out of school after the bell rings and knowing you have hours upon hours to play with friends, be creative, and enjoy some fun time sometimes seems a little less exciting as an adult. Like I said, on an average night, I\u2019m ready for dinner and bed once the work day is done.\n\nMaybe, then, it\u2019s not about embracing the darkness, but embracing the inner child and those childhood memories. Kind of like in The Polar Express, when the parents can\u2019t hear the bell, nor can the sister once she grows up, but the main boy who believes is always able to hear it.\n\nIt\u2019s all about belief, in that case, and seeing that light through the darkness \u2014 literally and figuratively. It\u2019s making time for fun, realizing that fatigue is mental just as much as it is physical, and sometimes going out and doing something active and fun in the evening wakes you up more than you thought it would.\n\nSo, I know it\u2019s a little early, but I think that\u2019s going to be part of my New Year\u2019s Resolution. Embracing the after-work darkness and having fun with it either way. Remembering to make fun and friends and play priorities in my life, as those are the things you\u2019re going to remember as you get older.\n\n\u2014 Clare Rayment, Kitimat Northern Sentinel editor",
