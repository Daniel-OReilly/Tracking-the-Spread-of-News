If that\u2019s the case, then the Kitimat Meter Station takes the pulse,\u201d joked Matthew Shanks, project manager for the metering station.\n\nWhile Wilde Lake facility construction is just beginning, Kitimat Meter Station construction is nearly complete.\n\n\u201cWe began construction in June working with our prime contractor, Aecon. Over the past five months, we\u2019ve worked through a lot of wet weather, held a groundbreaking ceremony in August, and made significant construction progress. In fact, we\u2019ve now completed five of the seven stages of facility construction, finishing with pipe installation,\u201d said Shanks.\n\nThe work was completed with no reportable safety incidents over 36,000 person-hours and an excess of 61,000 km, and in accordance with robust health and safety measures based on Dr. Bonnie Henry\u2019s guidance.\n\n\u201cA big highlight was the final weld on the meter station piping performed near the end of November. With that complete, we will now take a pause on construction activities on the facility until we return for pressure testing the pipe, scheduled for the second quarter of 2021. In the meantime, we will construct the powerline infrastructure for the station,\u201d added Shanks.\n\nCoastal GasLink is proud to be building more than just infrastructure. Our workers are committed to protecting the environment and supporting local communities as we progress the project.\n\nOver the course of construction, significant effort was made to protect the environment, including relocating approximately 40,000 tadpoles locally for safe maturing.\n\nAdditionally, the team formed relationships with the District of Kitimat community, participating in volunteer activities such as a river clean-up. The team also raised money for the Kitimat Food Bank and the Tamitik Status of Women organization, which was matched by TC Energy as well as Aecon Group for a $12,400 donation, divided equally between the two groups.\n\nFor M.J. Zimmerman, construction manager at the Kitimat Meter Station, the legacy of safety and quality Coastal GasLink is leaving behind is one that he is really proud of.\n\nThis commitment is part of our extraordinary legacy in action. As M.J. Zimmerman, construction manager at the Kitimat Meter Station, put it, \u201cthe legacy, the initiatives that Coastal GasLink is putting forward, it\u2019s about doing things safe with quality, and being really proud of it when you\u2019re done.\u201d He added that it\u2019s, \u201csomething you can talk about with your friends and colleagues, that we did it right.\u201d\n\nSign up today for construction updates at CoastalGasLink.com/construction-updates.\n\nenergy sector",
