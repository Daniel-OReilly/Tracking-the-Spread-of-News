(Screen capture)\n\nThe producer of a short film inspired by a true story set in Hazelton in 1908 is hoping to turn it into a series.\n\nThe film, Shadow Trap, is about a failed prospector, desperate for money who decides to go out looking for Simon Gunanoot, an outlaw with a hefty reward on his head. The journey takes him into the Skeena Mountains during a brutally cold winter where the hunter becomes the hunted.\n\nThe film debuted at the 2019 Vancouver Film Festival.\n\nDamien Gillis who also co-directed the film said this 17-minute film is only the beginning.\n\n\u201cIt is one of the most fascinating stories in B.C. history,\u201d he said.\n\nThe idea and support to start the film happened while he was making another film called Fractured Land, a documentary focusing on resource extraction through the eyes of a young Indigenous lawyer who walks in two different worlds, while also trying to protect his family\u2019s connection to the land.\n\nGillis spent a lot of time in the region making that film and has family in northern B.C.\n\n\u201cI spent a lot of time in the north as a kid hearing interesting stories about the north,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI kept hearing about the legend of Simon Gunanoot.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, Fractured Land won an award at Vancouver International Film Festival and with that, it carried prize money to write a script for another film.\n\n\u201cI thought this was a great opportunity to look into this story that I had been hearing so much about and kind of fallen in love with,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I did was meet with the decedents of Gunanoot in Hazelton.\u201d\n\nHe did a lot of research and said the family was supportive of him telling the story.\n\n\u201cIt is very important to our whole team that we work in connection with the family, it is their story, he said. \u201cEverything I\u2019ve done with the film has had that in mind. I also brought on several Indigenous filmmakers early on in the process of making this short film. As a settler filmmaker, it isn\u2019t my story to tell.\n\n\u201cWe put together a great team including my co-director Michael Bourquin, who is part Talhtan and part Gitxsan and lives in South Hazleton where this story is set.\u201d\n\nIn the film, Simon Gunanoot is played by Hazelton\u2019s own (and former Interior News reporter) Jermone Turner.\n\nGillis said the intention of this short film was a launching point for a series. He is hoping to move forward with the project into development next year.\n\nHe said there is huge appetite for good storytelling that is local and has its roots in the community the story is set in.\n\n\u201cAs well as Indigenous stories, there are some fantastic Indigenous filmmakers that are working today that have an opportunity to tell stories to a wider audience,\u201d he added.\n\nHis goal is to eventually set back from the creative side and be sure that the story is being told by Indigenous story tellers.\n\nWhile Shadow Trap was film in Barkerville, Gillis is hoping to film the new series in the Hazelton region.\n\n\u201cWe filmed in Barkerville because of the good snow conditions, the perfectly preserved town with historical buildings from the correct period, and access to local dog sleds teams,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the crew wants to ensure maximum authenticity moving forward and have as much benefit to the Gunaoot family and the surrounding community as possible while also leaving a positive legacy.\n\nShadow Trap can be viewed on the Crave TV app.",
