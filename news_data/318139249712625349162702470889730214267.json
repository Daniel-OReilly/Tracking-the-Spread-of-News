(File photo) Helen Watson\u2019s family had this book made to commemorate her 100th birthday. Watson turned 105 on Nov. 21, 2020. (Aaron Hinks photo)\n\nWhen Helen Watson\u2019s birthday rolled around last Saturday (Nov. 21), she couldn\u2019t party like she was 100 \u2013 as she did five years ago, when she actually turned 100 \u2013 but the South Surrey senior wasn\u2019t complaining.\n\nREAD MORE: Milestone birthday \u2018a whirl\u2019 for South Surrey senior\n\n\u201cIt was very nice, everybody was so good to me,\u201d Watson told Peace Arch News Monday (Nov. 23) of her 105th birthday celebration.\n\n\u201cIt was just fine the way it was.\u201d\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic firmly quashed any plans that may have otherwise been made to celebrate the occasion in the fashion it deserves.\n\nPandemic protocols months ago changed how family visits could take place for Watson, and earlier this month \u2013 after restrictions were ramped-up due to the ongoing surge in cases \u2013 the visits were halted altogether, in the name of safety.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s allowed in right now, and that\u2019s OK with us,\u201d Watson\u2019s son, Larry, said last week. \u201cI understand that they\u2019re very strict there. I\u2019m glad they\u2019re doing that because it\u2019s for the safety of everyone there.\u201d\n\nLarry said he and his wife had shifted how they visit some time ago, to standing at a safe distance outside his mom\u2019s window and speaking to her over the phone. They could see and hear each other more clearly than through the Plexiglas screen that had to separate them inside, he explained, and \u201cit seems like a better visit.\u201d\n\nThe 79-year-old said it\u2019s difficult to sum his mother\u2019s life up in just a few lines. Words that describe her have long included artist, independent and feisty.\n\nNow, the description also includes \u2018survivor of two global pandemics,\u2019 as Watson was three years old when the Spanish Flu struck in 1918.\n\n\u201cHer parents were affected by it, her father, he went deaf from it,\u201d Larry said.\n\nLarry said his mom is \u201cvery surprised\u2026 and maybe a little upset\u201d about the current pandemic, \u201cbecause she can\u2019t see her family.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the hard part for her, that she doesn\u2019t get to see anybody.\u201d\n\nWhen Watson first joined the ranks of centenarian in 2015, she welcomed a PAN reporter into her home, sharing a snippet of her creative side and just a few of the countless memories and experiences she has had \u2013 from an early childhood in Saskatchewan, to seeing her first airplane, to meeting her husband while working at St. Paul\u2019s Hospital in Vancouver, to travelling solo around the province and into the U.S. into her early nineties.\n\n\u201cI did everything,\u201d she said at the time.\n\n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t scared to go out and do things,\u201d her son said Monday.\n\nThe family marked Watson\u2019s first 100 years by publishing a book of photos, and this year, made her a blanket to take the chill off. They\u2019re looking forward to days when they can have a proper visit.\n\n\u201cHopefully everything will be OK in six months or so and her family can get back in and see her.\u201d\n\ntholmes@peacearchnews.com\n\nCoronavirusSeniorsSurrey",
