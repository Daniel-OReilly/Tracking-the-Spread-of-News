    "content": "Last week, Evan Salter received a tearful \u201cthank you\u201d from a grateful M\u00e9tis entrepreneur receiving a COVID-19 Emergency Fund business loan.\n\nIt was a heart-felt reminder for the CEO of the M\u00e9tis Financial Corporation of BC (MFCBC) that while the true toll of the pandemic isn\u2019t always apparent on the loan application, the unprecedented economic challenges are very real for business owners, their employees and their families.\n\n\u201cAs you work on these applications, sometimes you don\u2019t get a full sense of the stress business owners are experiencing,\u201d Salter reflects. \u201cThe most significant thing I\u2019ve heard as you start talking to people is the true impact \u2013 to be able to offer a little bit of help, it\u2019s pretty special.\u201d\n\nMFCBC opened for business Aug. 1, 2018 to assist BC\u2019s M\u00e9tis entrepreneurs to create new business, expand their existing business or acquire an established business. As a result, M\u00e9tis entrepreneurs in BC are now able to be served by a Metis-owned Aboriginal Financial Institution (AFI).\n\nToday, MFCBC is striving to become the first point of contact for M\u00e9tis entrepreneurs who\u2019ve experienced business challenges through the COVID-19 pandemic, a perfect example is the M\u00e9tis-owned company that had pivoted to produce personal protective equipment for frontline workers. With MFCBC\u2019s support, they were able to double their output.\n\nDesigned to help mitigate business impacts and plan for recovery from the COVID crisis, loans of up to $40,000 are available to M\u00e9tis-owned BC businesses \u2013 25 per cent of this is a contribution and 75 per cent a repayable. Featuring no payments for the first year, it is also completely interest-free over the life of the almost five-year term. Owners also received a checklist to assist them with a business restart plan, notes Salter, a CPA who before assuming leadership at MFCBC, spent six years as the Director of Business Development and Finance for the M\u00e9tis Voyageur Development Fund in Ontario, helping it become the largest Aboriginal Finance Institute in Ontario.\n\nAwareness, new products drive MFCBC growth\n\nAs awareness grows of MFCBC\u2019s initiatives, \u201cmomentum is really starting to build,\u201d Salter says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had several hundred queries, and since announcing the COVID loans program, we\u2019ve seen substantial uptick in applications. As we expand our suite of offerings, we expect that to continue to grow exponentially.\u201d\n\nAnd capacity for growth is significant.\n\nAccording to the national 2017 Aboriginal Peoples survey, 18 per cent of M\u00e9tis respondents identified as self-employed. This translates to 16,000+ self-employed M\u00e9tis in BC. Of these Metis-owned businesses, about one-third also had employees.\n\nIn fact, among the provinces, BC has the highest percentage of M\u00e9tis self-employment, represented in all major economic sectors, Salter notes. Further, 41 per cent of M\u00e9tis entrepreneurs in British Columbia are women.\n\nFrom MFCBC\u2019s first loan to a Kootenays-based backcountry education company to the COVID-19 emergency fund loans, MFCBC is the M\u00e9tis financer of choice, supporting M\u00e9tis businesses to fully participate in new and future economic opportunities.\n\nTo learn how the M\u00e9tis Financial Corporation of BC can support your business, visit mfcbc.ca or call 1-833-399-3926.\n\nFinanceLocal Business",
