According to the NHL, it\u2019s the first time all teams in the league have participated in the initiative. Each jersey represents \u201cunique and historical moments in each club\u2019s history, while refreshing the colour and design combination for an all-new presentation.\u201d\n\nPerhaps most pertinent for British Columbians is the Canucks retro jersey. The team had quite a few to choose from, having worn seven logo variations and 21 different uniforms over 50 years. Although it\u2019s faced some criticism on social media for not harkening back to the popular Black Skate jersey, the retro version is a play on the gradient orca jersey. That jersey was the alternate from 2001 to 2006, and according to the Canucks \u201cmarks a shift in Canucks hockey and the start of a new era.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nREAD MORE: NHLers weigh in on the idea of an all-Canadian division: \u2018It would be pretty unique\u2019\n\n@katslepian\n\nkatya.slepian@bpdigital.ca\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nWant to support local journalism during the pandemic?
