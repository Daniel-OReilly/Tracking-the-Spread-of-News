Any individual deemed to be at risk of exposure was contacted directly by Northern Health.\n\nIt is now over two weeks after the date of the positive test.\n\n\u201cPlease be reassured that our schools continue to implement the strict protocols and procedures we have in place so that students and staff can continue to attend school as safely as possible. The safety and well-being of our students, families and staff remains our highest priority,\u201d the board stated.\n\nFor any COVID-19 related questions, please contact: Northern Health Online Clinic at 1-844-645-7811.\n\nConrad School Start-Up\n\nPrincipal Kerri Levelton and vice-principal Tania Murray reported on the start-up at Conrad Street Elementary School. There are many differences in the way school is now run, in particular with visual reminders and lots of hand washing! Students are kept in cohorts, in part through divided recess and lunch breaks. Each class has a designated entrance and exit.\n\n\u201cThe Board was pleased to hear of the school\u2019s participation in the Downey & Wenjack Fund\u2019s legacy school project,\u201d said board chair James Horne. \u201cWe hope everyone will enjoy the memorial rocks students have placed on the Rushbrook trail.\u201d\n\nFramework for Enhancing Student Learning\n\nThe Framework for Enhancing Student Learning Committee met on Tuesday, Nov. 3.
