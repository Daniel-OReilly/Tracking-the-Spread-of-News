I knew the boy from school and he asked if I wanted to go to dinner and then go skating. I said sure.\n\nDinner was fine; he was a bit of a bore, but we still had a nice conversation.\n\nSkating was after dinner. Now, the other thing to note is that I\u2019m not a very good skater. I can skate well enough, but stopping is more of a \u2018glide until you slowly stop\u2019 rather than a purposeful one.\n\nWell, this boy was a good skater. Holding my hand while skating, literally skating circles around me, skating backwards in front of me; he was everywhere. At one point, while he was skating backwards in front of me, he even tried to lean in for a kiss. I pretended to fall, instead.\n\nNeedless to say, we didn\u2019t go out a second time. A mix of unexciting conversation and showing off really just didn\u2019t do it for me. I had to be very upfront about it though, because he seemed to think the date went very well and that we\u2019d be an official couple in due time.\n\nAnd see, that\u2019s the issue with dating. Unless the date is truly horrible or something goes completely wrong, it\u2019s sometimes hard to tell how the date went. One person may have had a great time, while the other only felt so-so. However, if you\u2019re lucky, both will have had a great time and will be asking each other out again shortly.\n\nThe world of dating is a complex world, which makes sense given that humans have complex feelings. For example, ask anyone what love feels like. There\u2019s no set dictionary description for love (actually that\u2019s a lie, there definitely is, but in my opinion, that\u2019s just the definition of the word, not the feeling).\n\nAccording to \u2018Love is Strange,\u2019 the song by rhythm and blues duo Mickey & Sylvia, once you get love, you never want to quit it. After you\u2019ve had it, you\u2019re in an awful fix. Essentially, love is an addiction.\n\nBut love can take many forms, as the feeling of love means something different to everyone, whether it\u2019s big or small, public or private, spoken aloud or shown through other actions.\n\nTo some, love is a significant other, bringing you a cup of tea without asking when they see that you look sad. To others, it may be a grand gesture with balloons, an orchestra, and expensive gifts. And the great thing is, both are valid definitions because love is different for everyone.\n\nTry to think about the first time you realized you loved someone. Let\u2019s stick with specifically romantic love this time around. Think about that moment. What were you doing? What did it feel like? What about that moment made something click to make you realize that you loved that other person?\n\nThat is a rare moment in your life and one I hope you\u2019re able to carry with you always. Even when love doesn\u2019t always work out, I hope that specific moment only brings happiness and good memories because it\u2019s such a special moment in time.\n\nAnd yes, of course, just like all things, love can change and grow, and also die. The feeling of love is its own entity, capable of causing pain just as much as it\u2019s capable of causing joy. And with dating, you never know what you\u2019re going to get.\n\nSo the question is, is it worth the risk? Is the happiness love brings worth the pain? I think most would argue yes, yes it is, not only because the potential happiness is such a fantastic feeling, but because you can grow and learn from the pain and realize it was all a part of your life for a reason.\n\nAlso, you often get some pretty funny stories later on from dates going horribly wrong!\n\nWas the skating boy worth the risk? There wasn\u2019t love, nor any pain involved really \u2014 except for how long it took me to convince him that I truly was not interested in another date. I\u2019d say that it was. Because dating is always an adventure, one way or another.\n\nAnd hey, I still got a free meal out of it, so it definitely couldn\u2019t have been all bad.\n\n\u2014 Clare Rayment, Kitimat Northern Sentinel editor\n\nREAD MORE: Clare\u2019s Corner: Proper punctuation can save lives\n\nREAD MORE: Tea: it picks you up, it does not let you down",
