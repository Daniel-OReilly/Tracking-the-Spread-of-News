    "content": "This past year has been a year of new knowledge, growth and a whole lot of spare time for many people as the COVID-19 pandemic shut down much of society and the Black Lives Matter movement inspired self-reflection.\n\nChristina Peck, Google Canada trends expert, said the year has been an unusual one when viewed through a search engine lens, too.\n\n\u201c2020 was not the year any of us expected,\u201d Peck told Black Press Media by phone. \u201cIt was unpredictable, heavy and really tested people around the world, and Canadians.\u201d\n\nGoogle compiles top trending searches every year and in this way, 2020 is no different. This year, Peck said, people were asking one big question: why?\n\n\u201cSometimes the answer made us cry, sometimes it sparked joy or worry, and in some cases it even inspired change,\u201d she said.\n\nSomewhere in all those emotion was the most-wanted item of the year, toilet paper.\n\n\u201cWhy are people buying toilet paper?\u201d was the most common \u201cwhy\u201d question asked of Google this year\n\n\u201cThis has been a topic of conversation throughout the pandemic,\u201d Peck said, and might be spiking again as B.C. introduces new restrictions and Ontario is in another lockdown.\n\nBut the list of \u201cwhy\u201d questions was not always so light. Many touched on more serious worries about COVID-19, while others were on the Black Lives Matter movement and the death of George Floyd at the hands of police.\n\n\u201cThis left many people wondering why we\u2019re asking the same questions, why are we seeing black men and women lose their lives?\u201d Peck said.\n\nThe top trending search of the year for Canadians is one that\u2019s still fresh for many: the U.S. election.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really dialled in and engaged into what\u2019s happening south of the border,\u201d Peck said, noting it\u2019s not unusual for American news to trend in any years. News of the election especially spiked during the debates leading up to voting day and the day itself.\n\nREAD MORE: Americans search for nearby liquor stores, French fries as they await election results\n\nThe third most trending search harkens back to the start of 2020, before most people knew what awaited them this year.\n\n\u201cKobe Bryant \u2013 this was a really devastating moment and when the news broke in January that Kobe along with his daughter Gianna had passed away\u2026 in the helicopter crash, it kind of stopped everybody,\u201d Peck said. \u201cKobe has inspired so many people both on and off the court.\u201d\n\nBut Bryant was sadly just the first of many celebrities deaths in 2020, \u201cgoodbyes we weren\u2019t ready to say.\u201d\n\nOne that likely hit Canadians the hardest was Alex Trebek, who died just over a month ago after a long battle with pancreatic cancer.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not only a Canadian icon but he\u2019s someone who Canadians and people around the world have invited into their homes night after night through \u2018Jeopardy!\u2019\u201d\n\nDespite everything that happened in 2020, Canadians did try to lighten up the mood as they faced months of job losses and pandemic restrictions. They searched for \u201ceasy cookie recipes\u201d and \u201csourdough discard recipes,\u201d before turning around and looking for \u201cresistance band workouts\u201d and \u201cChloe Ting workouts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all been at home so we\u2019re probably spending a little bit more time on social media \u2013 or on our phones or our devices \u2013 and we\u2019re seeing that people are turning to memes to find that joy,\u201d Peck said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fun ones here\u2026 Tiger King, Carole Baskin, Joe Exotic, Love is Blind, and toilet paper memes also come back up. It\u2019s a good indication of the year and some of the things that happened as people tried to find a little bit of laughter.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: What did Canadians watch on Youtube during isolation?
