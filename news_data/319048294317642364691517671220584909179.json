(Tiffanie Trudell/Facebook)\n\nA text message from Ryan Reynolds almost tipped off Damien Smith to one of the surprises in store for his upcoming ninth birthday.\n\nThe text from the Vancouver-born celebrity, loved by Damien for his portrayal of the comic-book character Deadpool, was prompted by an emotional request shared over Facebook by the boy\u2019s parents, Thomas Smith and Tiffanie Trudell.\n\nIn an Oct. 14 post, Smith and Trudell, who recently moved from Coquitlam to Canoe, explain how their son\u2019s birthday is coming up on Nov. 24. Instead of looking forward to the occasion, their boy was feeling blue.\n\n\u201cWe just moved to the Shuswap two weeks ago, and my boy\u2019s birthday is coming up and I asked him, \u2018Are you\u2026 excited about your birthday?\u2019\u201d explained Smith. \u201cAnd he\u2019s like, \u2018No, I\u2019m just going to be lonely.\u2019\u201d\n\nDamien\u2019s heart-wrenching response prompted the couple to ask the public for help in celebrating their son\u2019s special day.\n\n\u201cSince moving out of the city, he\u2019s been feeling pretty sad about his friends and our family not being around this year\u2026,\u201d reads the post, adding how with COVID-19 the family has chosen to not have a party.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m wondering is would anyone be interested in sending him some birthday cards in the mail?\u201d\n\nSoon after, the couple began receiving messages from people all over the world who said they would be sending cards. Despite the family\u2019s request for cards only, gifts also began showing up. One neighbour dropped off a Sidney Crosby jersey. Another person contacted the couple to say they would be making Damien a Deadpool birthday cake.\n\nNot long after a story about the card request was shared on the Salmon Arm Observer website, Damien was receiving visits from kids in the neighbourhood wanting to be his friend.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden we had these bangs on the door and there was a bunch if kids in our driveway and they all wanted to be Damien\u2019s friend ,and we\u2019re like, \u2018Oh my goodness, word travels fast out here,\u2019\u201d said Tiffanie. \u201cIt\u2019s a really beautiful community and we\u2019re so blessed to be out here.\u201d\n\nReynolds, who is known for sending special messages to fans, got wind of Tiffanie and Thomas\u2019 story. He texted the couple at dinner time to say he wanted to send Damien a little birthday video. Tiffanie began to cry with joy.\n\n\u201cThe boys were eating dinner and they\u2019re looking at me like, what\u2019s wrong with mom?\u201d said Tiffanie, laughing as she sets the scene. \u201cTom\u2019s like, \u2018What what!\u2019 I showed him the phone and he\u2019s like, \u2018Be quiet.\u2019\n\n\u201cSo we told Damien the reason mommy was crying was because we won a vacation but we can\u2019t take it because mommy is pregnant. So Damien is all mad because we can\u2019t go on vacation. And I go, I\u2019m sorry honey, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\nThursday morning, Oct. 22, the couple were on the phone with Reynolds\u2019 assistant, and Reynolds in the background. True to his word, Reynolds sent the family a birthday video for Damien.\n\n\u201cHe was in the background talking to us,\u201d said Tiffanie. \u201cI guess maybe he wanted her (the assistant) to handle it, but he started saying things to Tom.\u201d\n\nThe family plans to present Damien with the cards, gifts and the video on Nov. 21, when Bikers are Buddies members and others will be parading by their house to offer birthday wishes.\n\nOverwhelmed by and grateful for all of the support, Tiffanie said she and Thomas have been collecting about 50 cards a day from their post box, many from Shuswap residents.\n\nTiffanie and Thomas plan on reading the cards together with Damien, who struggles with reading. They also plan on sending out thank-you cards \u2013 a lot of thank-you cards.\n\n\u201cIts\u2019 going to be fun,\u201d said Tiffanie. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get them out \u2013 even if it takes us a couple of months.\u201d\n\nAnyone wishing to send Damien a happy birthday greeting can do so by mailing to the following address: Damien Smith, PO Box 321, Canoe, B.C., Canada, V0E1K0.\n\nRead more:\u201cI\u2019m just going to be lonely:\u201d Shuswap family asks for help celebrating son\u2019s birthday\n\nRead more: Bikers Are Buddies set up in North Okanagan-Shuswap\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter\n\nSalmon Arm\n\n\n\nSign up here Get local stories you won't find anywhere else right to your inbox.\n\nInstead of having a party, Thomas Smith and Tiffanie Trudell have asked the public to send their son, Damien (pictured), happy birthday cards.
