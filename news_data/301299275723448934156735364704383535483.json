(Kelsie Kilawna, Local Journalism Initiative Reporter)\n\nBy Kelsie Kilawna, Local Journalism Initiative Reporter, The Discourse\n\nIt\u2019s a sunny morning as cars whiz by at the Okanagan Indian Band (OKIB) community just outside of Vernon.\n\nShane Miller and Danielle Saddlemen are busy setting up their food truck to open later in the day. Once they\u2019re set, we sit down at a picnic table and instantly laughter and jokes start to fly across the table.\n\nTheir story is a love story. The two met and started dating in 1999.\n\n\u201cWe had this natural attraction to each other\u2026he was funny and made me laugh all the time even before we got together,\u201d says Saddleman.\n\nBut their journey together hasn\u2019t always been easy, it took a lot of healing to get to where they are today.\n\nAddictions is something that has plagued Indigenous communities for generations \u2014 often used as a coping mechanism in the face of colonization, residential school, the 60\u2019s Scoop and continued systemic discrimination.\n\nIn light of this, many Indigenous Peoples have also made powerful and consistent efforts to revive, reclaim, and create a resurgence of the old ways to survive.\n\nSaddleman and Miller are part of that revival, choosing to reclaim culture and language as a means to fight back against systems of oppression that have impacted them directly.\n\nIt\u2019s been just over seven years since the couple decided to become sober and commit to making for a brighter future for their family. Miller says he hopes to see more people make the same choice.\n\n\u201cI want to see more of the cycles being broken, seeing our families staying together, building a foundation that all our children need to grow and succeed,\u201d he says.\n\nFrom different worlds\n\nSaddleman grew up much differently from Miller. She was raised by many strong parental figures in the (OKIB) community. That helped to shape her into who she is today, she says, and in turn has supported her in sharing that same connection with Miller.\n\n\u201cI kind of have to show him what family is to me and this is how family was for me growing up,\u201d says Saddleman.\n\nMiller is a 60\u2019s Scoop survivor. He was taken from his home when he was an infant and placed into government care. He describes being bounced around from home to home and living his life in survival mode.\n\n\u201cWhen you grow up in survival mode, anything outside that survival mode you just don\u2019t care about, and that means you\u2019re hurting people, hurting your loved ones, families\u201d he says.\n\n\u201c(Learning these lessons) took me trial and error and I think back about it and it\u2019s all because of her.\u201d\n\n\u2018There was so much I didn\u2019t know\u2019\n\nMiller credits Saddleman for the healing he has experienced as a result of the infectious love she has shared with him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never known love, I\u2019ve never known family,\u201d Miller shares.\n\nGrowing up in an unstable environment, he says he was frequently left having to fight for his basic needs.\n\n\u201cI used to have to sneak upstairs, we lived in a basement suite, and I had to always sneak upstairs and steal food. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d he says.\n\nDuring his youth Miller lived on the streets and describes stealing food to survive. After aging out of the foster care system, Miller became a young parent at 20 years old.\n\nMiller shares that it was his upbringing that left him unequipped to raise his oldest daughter and that he caught himself continuing a cycle he never wanted for his family.\n\n\u201cI go around life and don\u2019t know what a family is, and trying to have kids at a young age and all you know how to do is run. I did it to my first kid.\u201d\n\nWhen Miller met Saddleman, he says that her love of family was infectious and it is one of the many reasons he became the man he is today. Saddleman says that when she met Miller, it was love at first sight and his sense of humour drew her in.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what attracted me to him and I always thought he was handsome, and I still have those feelings I first did from when we first got together to today,\u201d says Saddleman.\n\nFor Miller, identifying that love was more difficult.\n\n\u201cHow can I say I ever loved her in the beginning if I was disrespecting her for so many years?\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t understand it. It took me a long time to understand what love was, and it took me so long to even know what she was giving me.\u201d\n\nIn their early years together, Saddleman and Miller spent most weekends drinking and as they drank together Miller shares they fought often. He says that he was ignorant and disrespectful towards Saddleman and that it was her love and patience that brought him to this place of self-discovery today.\n\n\u201cIt took stupidity and ignorance on my part, and took hurt on her part,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not proud of that.\u201d\n\nThe family grows\n\nAfter years of promising one another they didn\u2019t want children, in 2004, the couple fell pregnant with their first daughter together. It was a blessing they didn\u2019t expect.\n\n\u201cI love her so much, we loved her, that\u2019s all she wanted was me or Shane,\u201d Saddleman says.\n\nWith their new baby, things shifted for the couple and the expectations of their relationship began to change. After a few years of continuing to drink alcohol together while parenting, Saddleman decided it was time to change things.\n\n\u201cI said we\u2019re done, you can go live with your mom and he did,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThe more he drank it would annoy me more, and I grew to hate the person Shane was then. I was just like we can\u2019t show our kids that.\u201d\n\nFor Miller, it was this ultimatum that led him to make the choice to be sober.\n\n\u201cI had to make a choice, and she said go ahead if you want to do drugs and party then like go ahead just not around the kids or me no more,\u201d he says.\n\nAfter Miller made the choice to be sober, he said that it was time for Saddleman to make the same choice.\n\n\u201cWe worked on it and did a couple of counselling sessions together,\u201d Saddleman says. \u201cFor me I was like well I\u2019m not going to quit drinking then\u2026 he threw the ball back in my court and said, `well, nope, if that\u2019s the life you\u2019re going to choose then we\u2019re not going to work.\u201d\u2019\n\nA journey of self-discovery\n\nWhen the couple decided to take the road to sobriety, that\u2019s when they say life really began.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at it that\u2019s half the reason Indigenous relationships fail if you take out the alcohol factor and the majority of those relationships would\u2019ve worked,\u201d says Miller.\n\n\u201cSelfishness is a big part too, she taught me not to be selfish because that\u2019s what you have to be when you\u2019re in survival to live.\u201d\n\nIt was the love for the culture and language that was instilled in Saddleman that helped heal their family.\n\n\u201cI always had a spark in me that really connected to language and culture and it wasn\u2019t until after I sobered up and went to school and started to learn all these things from a Sqilxw loosely translated as person Indigenous to the land perspective,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cOnce our people connect back to the land and culture they find pieces of themselves and it heals them and then they can have healthy relationships. And I feel like I\u2019ve had a taste of that and I know what culture has done for me and for Shane.\u201d\n\nFor Miller, culture was not something he was brought up with and credits his partner for all she has done for not only him by introducing the culture but also what she\u2019s done for the community.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re Saddleman the one putting it all together and for me, that means a lot. It helps me in my healing now that piece of the pie that was missing is whole. Now that addictions piece that was pulled out has been put back in. Breaking that cycle filled that hole,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe circle is now complete again and culture was that last piece.\u201d\n\nAdvice for others\n\nMiller and Saddleman have now been together for 20 years. After having their daughter, they also welcomed a second child in 2006. Their advice to other families? It\u2019s important to confront your past so that it doesn\u2019t impact your ability to heal.\n\n\u201cBefore it was really hard because alcohol blocked all of that and turned it into anger, now when I talk like this I get emotional and it\u2019s a release, it\u2019s a part of that healing,\u201d Miller says.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t you carry it around, and it eats you, and if you don\u2019t deal with that you turn to things that numb that pain.\u201d\n\nSaddleman says that it\u2019s always good to remember to laugh together.\n\n\u201cHumour, it\u2019s one of those things that keeps our relationship alive. He is just so funny and I kind of bounce off of it, we\u2019re always teasing each other,\u201d she says.\n\nAs the two continue to move forward in their relationship, they are now running three businesses: a food truck, catering company and co-owning a cannabis dispensary.\n\nIn their life, community and culture are the priorities.\n\n\u201cComing together as a community and reviving culture and get that sense of Kn\u2019Sqlixw, of what is it? What is a good relationship? With our ties to the land, our ties to the culture, that\u2019s what I really want,\u201d says Saddleman.\n\nMiller shares the same sentiment, that it\u2019s time to break the cycles that have taken so many Indigenous Peoples from their paths.\n\n\u201cIf you look at us as a whole and you look at the mental illnesses that we have, it\u2019s like our soul is gone, the spirit doesn\u2019t know what to do with our minds. Our minds have been mined, and now our minds have been affected by it,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still fighting to keep our culture, we sing our songs, we put our energy into the air.\u201d\n\nSaddleman says it\u2019s important for them and others in their community to return to the land to learn what it means to be Sqilxw.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about having a positive wellbeing, spirit and soul and to be able to experience that together,\u201d says Miller.\n\nSaddleman adds that it\u2019s important to also remember to not be ashamed by the colonial circumstances that Indigenous Peoples often find themselves dealing with.\n\n\u201cI think what\u2019s helped us is that we had to understand our past and move forward. It was colonization and residential school and all of the wrongs done to our people\u2026it\u2019s not our parents or grandparents\u2019 fault to what happened.\u201d\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nWant to support local journalism?
