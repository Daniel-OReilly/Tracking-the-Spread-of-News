They\u2019re out there every day fighting the virus and risking their own lives in doing so, to care for the British Columbians who are ill and need their help.\n\nAnd make no mistake: the skilled trades people who work in construction are also out there on the front lines. The front lines of our economy and our resilience. They\u2019re out there applying their hard-earned skills and experience to build and maintain the structures we all rely on every day, to keep us functioning safely.\n\nAt nearly 10 per cent of BC\u2019s total workforce and GDP, construction is essential to the health of our communities. Not just because of the size of the payroll, but because the built environment is essential to our very functioning as a society.\n\nWhile we\u2019re isolated at home because our businesses have been closed, or because we are caring for a loved one, we are \u2013 often invisibly \u2013 served by our tradespeople. Their work keeps the electricity and water and Netflix coming. It keeps the rain out and the heat in. It keeps the walls up and lights on.\n\nAnd BC\u2019s construction industry is building the new critical infrastructure that will be essential to recovery.\n\nSo this April, the third annual Construction and Skilled Trades Month in BC, please join the BC Construction Association, four Regional Construction Associations, LNG Canada, and many other generous sponsors, in recognizing the efforts of the construction workers in your life and your community.\n\nNext time you\u2019re passing a worksite (from a six-foot distance), give the workers a nod and a thank you. They\u2019re doing an important job. They are essential.\n\nWe briefly considered cancelling Construction Month this year. But in the midst of extreme hardship it\u2019s even more important to take a moment to thank people for the work they do to make our community strong. When your moment comes to say thank you, use it well.\n\nConstructionskilled trades",
