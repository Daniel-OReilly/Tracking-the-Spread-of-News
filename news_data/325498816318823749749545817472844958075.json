And Columbus never came here.\n\nWe have laboured under this colonial pretension for too long.\n\nBesides the abbreviated \u201cB.C.\u201d commonly used today is meaningless.\n\nWhen can we take pride in our province\u2019s name, flag, and coat-of-arms?\n\nThe government should ask the Indigenous peoples to come up with a new name that will reflect the province\u2019s more than 10,000 years of history, awesome grandeur, diverse bio-geoclimatic zones, and its mosaic of multi-cultures.\n\nThe new name \u2013 hopefully easily pronounceable, spelled and short \u2013 could be proclaimed on the 150th anniversary of the province\u2019s entry into the Canadian confederation on July 20, 2021.\n\nThis would be in accordance with Premier John Horgan\u2019s recent challenge of \u201cthinking outside the box\u201d in the \u201cnew normal\u201d after the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nA new name will demonstrate solid confidence in ourselves as a province that is inclusive of all its residents, rather than clinging to coattails of British colonists.\n\nThe name, of course, cannot be fully changed overnight because it is a complex matter.\n\nHowever, many countries had the fortitude to make a start and go through a liberating process of choosing a new name \u2013 such as Ghana, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Zambia, Mali \u2013 and implementing it fast.\n\nIf we keep the status quo, we are only confirming that all our talk about reconciliation with our Indigenous peoples is only tokenism and not full and respectful inclusion.\n\nBen Pires, Victoria\n\nDo you have an opinion you\u2019d like to share?
