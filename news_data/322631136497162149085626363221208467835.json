Experts in taxation and media say a plan announced Monday by the government will ultimately add to the cost of digital services and goods sold by foreign companies. THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP-Jenny Kane\n\nThe cost of digital services and goods sold by foreign companies like Netflix will go up under a taxation plan the government wants to put in place next year, experts said Tuesday.\n\nOttawa said in its fiscal update released Monday it will require multinationals to collect GST or HST on digital products and services, which it said would add up to $1.2 billion over five years.\n\nSometimes labelled a \u201cNetflix tax,\u201d the measure would also apply to other services such as Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s Prime Video or the Spotify audio streaming service, as well as digital products such as software applications.\n\nThe government says Canadian companies already collect those taxes when they make digital sales, so it\u2019s only fair that foreign multinationals should do the same.\n\nKPMG tax partner Joe Micallef said it\u2019s likely Canadians will end up paying the taxes collected for the government by foreign multinationals.\n\n\u201cRight now, the way in which they\u2019re delivering their services, they\u2019re not responsible for the collection,\u201d Micallef said.\n\n\u201cAnd so, effectively, it would mean that these charges would be appearing on (their) invoices.\u201d\n\nA regular monthly subscription for a streaming service that delivers video or music would be a simple calculation, with the tax rate applied to the purchase price.\n\nBut Micallef said it is be more difficult to estimate how much additional tax individual consumers, or businesses, will pay for other types of digital purchases, he said.\n\nSomething like gaming software might cost little or nothing itself, but offer the option for subsequent charges to add features that make the experience better.\n\n\u201cHow many times? How many transactions? It adds up,\u201d Micallef said.\n\nDwayne Winseck, a media industry researcher at Carleton University in Ottawa, also expects companies will add the price of the tax to the total sale price.\n\n\u201cI mean, this is really not a very substantial amount, when we\u2019re talking about corporate finances,\u201d said Winseck, who is a professor of journalism and communication.\n\nHe said that the term \u201cNetflix tax\u201d has become highly politicized and is often used as \u201ccode\u201d for levelling the playing field between U.S.-based digital media companies and traditional Canadian broadcasters.\n\n\u201cAnd if the idea is to create a level playing field between those two services, then that by all means that makes great sense,\u201d Winseck said.0\n\nDavid Paddon, The Canadian Press\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nWant to support local journalism?
