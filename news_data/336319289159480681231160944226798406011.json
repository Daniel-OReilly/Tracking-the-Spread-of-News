Forest Service he began making long, brisk strolls through his community.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have a goal when I retired,\u201d Doi recalled, reasoning that setting targets might take the fun out of it.\n\nBut he did keep track of his mileage, and one day, realized he was nearing an interesting milestone.\n\nIf he kept it up, he would have walked a distance equivalent to the circumference of the earth \u2013 24,901 miles or 40,075 kilometres.\n\n\u201cIn 2018, I decided that would be my goal,\u201d Doi related.\n\nHe upped his pace, walking twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening, four miles each time.\n\nOn Sept. 17, about 21 years after he began, he achieved his goal.\n\n\u201cI was thinking about having some champagne, [but] I\u2019m a low-key fellow,\u201d Doi confided.\n\nHe has scaled back his walking since he achieved his goal, to a single 3.2 round-trip from his townhouse.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to do it again,\u201d he laughed.\n\n\n\ndan.ferguson@langleyadvancetimes.com\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter\n\nCommunityLangley",
