(Submitted photo)\n\nA jersey patch has created controversy within Chilliwack FC.\n\nMembers of CFC\u2019s women\u2019s premier team say the youth soccer club has punished them for wearing an LGBTQI2S+ and BIPOC symbol on their uniform.\n\nLGBTQI2S+ is a term that stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (or questioning), intersex, and two-spirit and BIPOC stands for black, Indigenous and people of colour.\n\nThe team\u2019s players wanted to show support for marginalized, underrepresented groups and met with the CFC board to present the idea. According to Brandon Lupton, a team supporter and partner to one of the players, the club expressed concern that the suggested patch could be negatively received and suggested that \u201cChilliwack isn\u2019t ready.\u201d\n\nCFC chairperson Andrea Laycock said the conversation was more nuanced than that.\n\nShe said that while the board expressed support for the concepts of inclusivity and diversity, they felt a CFC jersey wasn\u2019t the right place to make a political statement.\n\nCFC\u2019s adult liasion, Richard Tagle, said that following the initial meeting, his daughter Megan Tagle and three players from the women\u2019s team worked to come up with an alternative. They produced three words, \u2018Respect for ALL,\u2019 which could be used on jerseys, used as a #hashtag on Twitter, and utilized in other ways.\n\n\u201cThree players had a long discussion with Megan and I,\u201d Tagle said. \u201cAfter that meeting, I met with the three plus the captain of the Div 1 team to discuss the proposal. The five of us came to an agreement to begin with \u201cRespect for ALL\u201d on the jersey, and the three would begin an educational video program on our website and social media to take steps to move towards an symbol to be placed on the jersey.\n\n\u201cAt no time were we in disagreement with a symbol, but solely on the speed at which we would proceed. Again, all five were in agreement and I took that back to the board for approval.\u201d\n\nLaycock thought it was a \u201cgood first step,\u201d and CFC planned to have the words on 1,200 jerseys in the association.\n\nThey still do.\n\nBut in the end the women\u2019s players weren\u2019t satisfied and didn\u2019t think the alternative went as far as they wanted. They opted to wear their preferred option on the sleeve of their jerseys.\n\nThat decision had immediate consequences.\n\n\u201cAfter just one game, complaints from a bystander made their way to the chairperson of Chilliwack FC (Andrea Laycock),\u201d Lupton explained. \u201cForty eight hours after the team\u2019s first game, they received an email stating that the board requested a meeting with them to discuss disciplinary action for the embellishment of the uniform.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Gay, bisexual teens half as likely as straight teens to play sports: UBC study\n\nREAD MORE: Chilliwack FC hands out player awards virtually\n\nA few days after the meeting, Lupton said three players received a two-game suspension and a warning of further discipline (longer suspension, or revoking of membership) if the misconduct continued.\n\nThe players appealed the ruling on the grounds of unfair and excessive disciplinary action, offering to accept a one game suspension.\n\nTheir appeal was denied.\n\nLaycock said the players would have run afoul of the board putting anything on their jerseys, and the two-game suspension was upheld because their attempt to circumvent the wishes of the CFC board was \u201cdeliberate and premeditated.\u201d\n\nShe said nothing would have been done if the patch had appeared on hoodies or track pants or shoes.\n\n\u201cBut our policy is pretty clear that nothing goes on the jerseys without board approval,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are open to changing that, but it has to fall in line with our policies and our mandate of having kids on the field playing soccer. It\u2019s not that the board doesn\u2019t support the idea of having a patch or a flag, but we have to be mindful of how we approach it and respect the community.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not incumbent on the executive to impose our political and personal beliefs on the membership. We have to be mindful of everybody\u2019s needs.\u201d\n\nTagle said CFC had no issue with the symbol itself, beyond its presence on the jerseys.\n\n\u201cThe symbol could have been advertising for Chilliwack Ford or a cross or anything and we would have had the same issue,\u201d he noted. \u201cWhat is placed on the jersey, including colours, is solely the board\u2019s decision. This is to prevent symbols of hate, religion, adverts, etc. being placed on the jersey.\n\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with what this particular symbol represents.\u201d\n\nLupton said the advocate players requested that the uniform policy be changed, with a policy amendment proposal submitted to include wearing symbols supporting social justice and commemoration, for example.\n\n\u201cThis request has not yet been acknowledged by Chilliwack FC executive board,\u201d he noted.\n\nLupton said the situation is particularly frustrating with professional sport leagues such as the NCAA, NBA, and NFL supporting the use of patches and stickers related to social justice issues.\n\n\u201cA community soccer club\u2019s decision to punish players for showing support for statements that align with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and genuine human inclusion is unacceptable,\u201d Lupton said. \u201cThe unprofessional handling and conduct of this issue by the Chilliwack FC board is appalling and needs to be acknowledged to create change.\u201d\n\nLaycock said CFC board felt strongly that \u2018Respect for ALL\u2019 would get a conversation started, and the board stands by their choice.\n\n\u201cThe words can represent LGBTQI2S+ and BIPOC, but they can also be applied to 101 things like respect for your opponents, your teammates, officials, your community,\u201d Laycock said. \u201cWe felt it was a good first step and an opportunity to grow and educate as we continue.\u201d\n\n@ProgressSports\n\neric.welsh@theprogress.com\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nWant to support local journalism during the pandemic?
