Patterson)\n\nVanderbilt\u2019s Sarah Fuller became the first woman to participate in a Power Five conference football game when she kicked off to start the second half against Missouri on Saturday in Columbia, Mo.\n\nFuller kicked off the turf with a holder rather than using a tee, and she sent a low kick to the 35-yard line where it was pounced on by Missouri\u2019s Mason Pack. Fuller didn\u2019t get any opportunities in the first half as the Tigers opened a 21-0 lead over the Commodores. Missouri won 41-0.\n\nFuller, a senior goalkeeper on the Vanderbilt soccer team, joined the football team this week after helping the Commodores win the Southeastern Conference Tournament last weekend. COVID-19 protocols and restrictions left Vandy football coach Derek Mason with a limited number of specialists available against Missouri. Mason reached out to soccer coach Darren Ambrose for some help.\n\nFuller agreed to give football a try and practised with the winless Commodores before making the trip to Missouri. She wore \u201cPlay Like A Girl\u201d on the back of her helmet.\n\n\"I just want to tell all the girls out there that you can do anything you set your mind to, you really can. And if you have that mentality all the way through, you can do big things.\" Sarah Fuller is an inspiration \ud83d\ude4c pic.twitter.com/rUi1hJYap9 \u2014 SEC Network (@SECNetwork) November 28, 2020\n\nNo woman had appeared in an SEC football game or for any Power Five team.
