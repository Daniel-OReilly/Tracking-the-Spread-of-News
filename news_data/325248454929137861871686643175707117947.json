(File collage)\n\nBy Laird Cronk & Sussanne Skidmore\n\nThis Labour Day is a lot different from past years. You won\u2019t see the big parades, rallies and parties we usually have. Instead it\u2019s small, carefully-distanced backyard get-togethers and on-screen virtual celebrations.\n\nBut there\u2019s a deeper change that\u2019s happening too. Something important has shifted in British Columbia.\n\nThis year has reminded us all of just how utterly and completely our province relies on working people: to keep our economy going, to provide the necessities of life, to deliver the services families need.\n\n2020 has taught us that the front lines are much broader and deeper than many people assumed. Suddenly, many of the lowest-paid workers in the most precarious jobs in BC are finally getting some long-overdue recognition. And we\u2019ve stopped seeing workplace safety as something that only affects individual workers, and recognizing it for what it is: a vital underpinning of public health.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, we\u2019re discovering that there\u2019s a lot more we can be doing to make life better for all of us. The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted governments to come together with quick, dramatic action on a wide range of fronts: supporting the incomes of laid-off workers, protecting vulnerable British Columbians with increases to disability and income assistance rates, providing help for renters, subsidizing wages, investing in health care and education, improving employment standards and workplace safety, and even making the first moves toward paid sick leave.\n\nOf course, a lot of this has happened because BC has the benefit of a provincial government that listens to working people. The contrast with other provinces \u2014 and south of the border \u2014 is often stark.\n\nBut we\u2019ve also had something else on our side: a strong, determined labour movement backed by working people across BC. And there\u2019s every reason to believe that movement is gaining strength.\n\nThere\u2019s a new momentum for organizing, and a big part of that comes as the pandemic shows working people that our lives are on the line. The stronger and more united we are, the better we\u2019re able to press for safer workplaces, better working conditions and a fairer deal.\n\nAnd that\u2019s doubly important now, because we\u2019ve learned something else in the past several months.\n\nCOVID-19 exposed how deep and wide the gaps in our province are, and how many people have been left out and sold short in BC\u2019s economy. Those gaps and inequities weren\u2019t just unfair in and of themselves. They were vulnerabilities the virus exploited, and left us all more exposed and at risk.\n\nBut the way we\u2019ve responded, as communities and through our governments, shows us we don\u2019t have to just accept those gaps. And we don\u2019t have to recreate those inequities.\n\nSo as much as 2020 has been about shutting down, it\u2019s also increasingly about opening up \u2014 that is, opening up possibilities for positive, lasting changes. And this year, that\u2019s what\u2019s really worth celebrating: this new sense of possibility and potential in the strength we have together.\n\nThe pandemic is far from over, but the rebuilding in BC has begun. And as we rebuild, we can regain what we had \u2014 but we can also rebuild something stronger and fairer.\n\nWe can build stronger, more resilient communities that are better able to grapple with big challenges, whether it\u2019s ending this pandemic, fighting off the next one or addressing the threat of climate change. We can build a fairer, greener economy where everyone can benefit \u2014 and where we make every job a good job. We can make investments that improve crucial services everywhere from classrooms to hospitals to transit.\n\nAnd thanks to the working people of British Columbia, we are going to emerge from this pandemic. So that we can hold out hope that next year, we\u2019ll be able to truly celebrate together.\n\nHappy Labour Day, everyone.\n\nLaird Cronk is the president and Sussanne Skidmore is the secretary-treasurer for the BC Federation of Labour.\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nWant to support local journalism?
