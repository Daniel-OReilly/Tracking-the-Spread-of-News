While BC Children\u2019s Hospital is home to experts leading the way in treating the most aggressive cancers, a devastating 20 per cent of children who are diagnosed with cancer will not survive the next five years.\n\nIt was a phone call that Glenn and Sharon Bulger will never forget. On Jan. 18, 2018, their son\u2019s school called to tell them that Cameron suddenly wasn\u2019t able to speak or make eye contact with anyone.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to the school and went up to Cameron, his gaze went right past me,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cWe were rushed to the hospital from there.\u201d\n\nA CT scan at their local hospital in Surrey revealed that the six-year-old had a mass in the right frontal lobe of his brain. He was quickly transferred to BC Children\u2019s Hospital, where he underwent surgery that successfully removed 99 per cent of the mass.\n\nBut after additional tests, the family received unfathomable news: Cameron had an aggressive form of brain cancer, known as a grade IV malignant embryonic brain tumour. Over the next six months, he endured rounds of chemotherapy and stem cell transplants.\n\nAfter his treatment, Cameron was declared in remission. But just months later, his cancer returned \u2013 this time, it had spread to an inoperable part of his brain.\n\nDetermined to save their son\u2019s life, Sharon and Glenn explored all possible new drug trials worldwide, with the support of their oncology care team at BC Children\u2019s. However, the disease progressed so quickly that ultimately, the one option left wasn\u2019t available to him soon enough.\n\nOn May 16, 2020, two and a half years after he was first brought to the hospital, Cameron passed away peacefully, at home, surrounded by his loved ones.\n\nChallenging the status quo\n\nBC Children\u2019s Hospital is home to experts who are leading the way in treating the most aggressive cancers \u2013 but even so, a devastating 20 per cent of children who are diagnosed with cancer will not survive the next five years. Cameron was one of the 20 per cent. As Dr. Caron Strahlendorf, Division Head of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant at BC Children\u2019s Hospital explains, so much more needs to be done to improve outcomes for children.\n\n\u201cWe are very fortunate that we\u2019ve seen greatly improved cancer survival rates over the decades,\u201d said Dr. Strahlendorf. \u201cHowever, there are still children who are succumbing to their diagnoses or who live with life-long side effects as a result of the treatments used to heal them. BC Children\u2019s is determined to change that.\u201d\n\nPhilanthropy plays a powerful role in helping experts push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in childhood cancer care, as well as countless other health challenges that kids face. That\u2019s why BC Children\u2019s Hospital Foundation, the hospital\u2019s fundraising arm, is on a mission to rally British Columbians in supporting the cutting-edge technology and groundbreaking research that are needed to conquer childhood illnesses.\n\n\u201cDonors are so important to helping us advance research and improve care,\u201d explained Dr. Strahlendorf. \u201cFor instance, they help enable our team of scientists and clinicians to identify what is causing these children to react differently to treatments \u2013 and to determine if there\u2019s something unique about their cancer that will enable us to take a more personalized approach.\u201d\n\nFor families like the Bulgers, it can bring renewed hope when it\u2019s needed most.\n\n\u201cWe ran out of time to save Cameron, but together, we have the chance to save other children who are diagnosed with rare and hard-to-treat cancers,\u201d Sharon said.\n\nInterested in learning more about how you can support the fight to conquer childhood illnesses?
