The 66-lot shared interest lakefront development features 45 fully serviced RV lots and 20 cabin sites, all just steps from the beach and lake.\n\nSummer is all about experiences we\u2019ll share for years to come: Paddles on the lake, forest trails to explore and tall tales told around the campfire \u2013 maybe about the fish that got away that very afternoon!\n\nThe chance to write your summer story is here.\n\n(And even better, you can add to it come fall and winter!)\n\nYour story starts at Sugar Lake, just an hour east of Vernon and less than two hours\u2019 drive from Kelowna \u2013 so easy to get to, but what a difference once you get here.\n\nThe Sugar Lake Recreational Properties is at the heart of lake life \u2013 your waterfront base for the adventures yet to come. The 66-lot shared interest lakefront development features 45 fully serviced RV lots and 20 cabin sites, all just steps from the beach and lake.\n\nWhile other regions in the Okanagan and Shuswap can quickly get busy with boats, swimmers and other recreation enthusiasts, here you\u2019ll enjoy many of the same opportunities, but away from the crowds, in your own piece of paradise. And if you simply want to share the sun with your go-to beach read, that\u2019s just fine too!\n\nRounding out the amenities onsite are a new dock with boat slips available for lease, group picnic areas to share a meal with family and friends, and even an on-site guest lodge, with its own licensed, full-service bistro.\n\nOf course, not all experiences are focused around the lake, so from Sugar Lake, it\u2019s easy to turn the page and choose your own adventure.\n\nOutdoor recreation opportunities take you off the lake and into thousands of hectares of forest begging to be explored. Cast your rod into nearby rivers and streams, or head to the hills of Silver Star, where summer and fall mountain biking gives way to winter skiing and snowshoeing.\n\nJust 14 kilometres north, explore Cherryville, where recreation opportunities include bird watching, horseback tours, fishing and more in the foothills of the Monashee Mountains. Continue east to Monashee Provincial Park to enjoy spring wildflowers, hiking, fishing and some of the oldest rock formations in Western Canada.\n\nAnd a little farther afield to Nakusp, experiences include inviting hot springs, a thriving local arts community and the waterfront walkway overlooking Upper Arrow Lake.\n\nReady to write your next chapter at Sugar Lake? Learn about vendor financing for your own carefully selected RV site or cabin, and about maximizing your investment with the option of renting out your site or cabin when you\u2019re not using it. The management team can oversee all the details, and if you change your mind, withdrawing from the rental pool is just as easy.\n\nDiscover the possibilities awaiting your family today at sugarlakelife.ca or email info@sugarlakelife.ca\n\nBC LakesImpressive West CoastOkanaganOutdoors and Recreation",
