    "content": "To say Lacey was in rough shape when she was rescued from a Surrey property five years ago would be an understatement.\n\nThe blue-eyed palomino paint yearling was gaunt, with skinny limbs, overgrown hooves and a fear of everything, even a blanket.\n\nFortunately, to say she\u2019s doing alright these days is also an understatement.\n\n\u201cShe looks amazing now, it\u2019s hard to believe that it\u2019s the same pony,\u201d said Lacey\u2019s \u2018mom,\u2019 Kathy Gilleran.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the most loving and affectionate and trusting pony you could imagine. That\u2019s kind of what blew my mind with her.\u201d\n\nLacey was among nearly five dozen animals that were seized by the SPCA during a cruelty investigation in August of 2015.\n\nREAD MORE: 57 animals seized in \u2018disgusting\u2019 case of neglect\n\nUnfortunately, the seizure was not the first that the BC SPCA has dealt with involving horses, nor was it the last. Most recently, 27 horses were among nearly 100 animals seized by cruelty-investigation officers in late September from a farm near Princeton.\n\nIn each case, extensive \u2013 and expensive \u2013 efforts are taken to treat, rehabilitate and rehome all of them.\n\nAnd while for some, the story does not have a happy ending despite best efforts, many others, matched with the love and attention every creature deserves, go on to thrive.\n\nIt is these stories of hope, perseverance and survival that inspired Kamloops photographer Leanne Peniuk to do what she could to help.\n\nPeniuk began a quest last spring to capture the \u201chappily-ever-after stories\u201d for a book that would be sold to raise funds for the BC SPCA\u2019s equine division.\n\n\u201cEvery horse is given a second chance and I just kind of wanted to showcase that and tell their stories,\u201d Peniuk said.\n\nRescue Me \u2013 published in November \u2013 is a coffee-table-style book that shares the stories of 25 horses, including Lacey, that have been rescued by the BC SPCA and successfully rehomed.\n\nThe goal, said Peniuk, is threefold, including inspiring people to consider adopting or fostering a rescue horse.\n\n\u201cAnd if one person drives by a field and sees horses that maybe don\u2019t have water, food or shelter, or maybe don\u2019t look the best \u2026 they take action and place a phone call to the SPCA, then it serves its purpose.\u201d\n\nLacey, a palomino paint, is in \u201camazing\u201d shape now, compared to when she was rescued in August 2015. (Leanne Peniuk photo)\n\nEvery year, the BC SPCA seizes between 50 and 100 horses from unhealthy situations, and in her five years as manager of the BC SPCA\u2019s equine division, Leiki Salumets has seen it all.\n\nSalumets remembers that Lacey was a recent arrival when she started at the society\u2019s Good Shepherd barn in Surrey that August.\n\nKnowing how far Lacey has come offsets the heartache side of the job, she said.\n\nSalumets\u2019 personal experience with a rescue horse is also shared in Rescue Me. That horse, she said, \u201ctaught me kind of the most.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a big part of the reason I do what I do.\u201d\n\nLacey as she is now, in one of several photographs featured in Rescue Me. (Leanne Peniuk photo)\n\nProceeds from the sale of Rescue Me are earmarked to support the care and rehabilitation of the Princeton rescues.\n\nTypically, the BC SPCA relies \u201cheavily\u201d on donor support to provide the care such animals need, said Salumets, describing the effort behind Rescue Me as \u201cjust incredible.\u201d\n\nPublisher Jill Veitch \u2013 who grew up in South Surrey but now calls Kelowna home \u2013 described it as \u201cheartwarming.\u201d\n\nVeitch said she learned of Peniuk\u2019s quest through social media, and \u201cinstantly\u201d messaged Peniuk, \u201cbecause I have (a rescue horse) and it\u2019s been an absolute life-changer for my family.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nThe foreword in Rescue Me is written by self-described rescuer, horseman and philosopher Kevan Garecki.\n\nThe book also include insights from Salumets and a prominent foster caregiver, as well as some information on the process that surrounds an SPCA seizure.\n\nPeniuk said even though the book is finished, there is another chapter yet to come.\n\n\u201cNext year, I want to work\u2026 on horses saving humans,\u201d she said.\n\nFor more information or to order Rescue Me ($55) visit www.leannepeniukphotography.ca/rescue-me\n\ntholmes@peacearchnews.com\n\nBCSPCASurreywhite rock",
