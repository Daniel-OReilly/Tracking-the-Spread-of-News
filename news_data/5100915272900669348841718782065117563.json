    "content": "Thirty years ago, the federal department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) mismanaged the Atlantic cod fishery into near oblivion \u2013 ignoring the scientists who foresaw the collapse.\n\nInstead, DFO rigged the science to support an unsustainable commercial fishery. Politicians vowed \u201cnever again\u201d and enshrined the precautionary principle into law \u2013 always err on the side of caution \u2013 but did nothing to reform the institution responsible for one of the world\u2019s greatest self-inflicted ecological disasters. Today, DFO does whatever is necessary to support Atlantic salmon farming along B.C.\u2019s coast to the significant threat of wild Pacific salmon.\n\nOnly Canada allows the farming of Atlantic salmon on the migration routes of wild Pacific salmon. And, just like thirty years ago, DFO continues to rig science so it can skirt its primary duty to protect B.C.\u2019s iconic, keystone species.\n\nIn 2009, after conducting a three-year federal Inquiry into declining salmon runs, Mr. Justice Cohen saw the essential problem \u2013 DFO might ignore fish farming\u2019s risks to promote the industry. Along with 74 other recommendations, he recommended that DFO not be required to both promote and regulate fish farming. But, DFO\u2019s conflicted mandate persists.\n\nIn 2015, the Federal Court found DFO had not adhered to the precautionary principle \u2013 the law of our land \u2013 when regulating the foreign Piscine orthoreovirus saying DFO\u2019s \u201carguments with respect to the precautionary principle are inconsistent, contradictory and, in any event, fail in light of the\n\nevidence.\u201d Four months later, DFO reinstated the same policy, adopting a risk threshold that prohibited only risks that could sterilize entire populations, species, or ecosystems. The Federal Court again struck down the policy, which DFO reinstated and is before the Federal Court for a third time.\n\nIn 2018, the Auditor General found DFO was woefully behind in its risk assessments, was not enforcing aquaculture regulations, and was \u201cvulnerable to claims that it prioritized the aquaculture industry over the protection of wild fish.\u201d The same year, Canada\u2019s Chief Scientist recommended DFO have unbiased advice from an external advisory committee. Still, no external oversight exists.\n\nIn December 2019, our Prime Minister mandated DFO\u2019s minister to transition B.C.\u2019s \u201cin ocean\u201d salmon farms on to land by 2025. Welcome words. But, almost a year later, British Columbians and the 102 B.C. First Nations which support this transition have seen no action by DFO.\n\nMr. Justice Cohen also recommended fish farming in the Discovery Islands (a bottleneck for migrating salmon) be prohibited by September 30, 2020, unless DFO could confidently say the farms there posed less than minimal harm to wild Pacific salmon.\n\nOn September 28, 2020, with the Fraser River experiencing the worst sockeye returns in history, and with the Minister absent, DFO officials proclaimed that the Discovery Island fish farms posed less than a 1% risk to Fraser River sockeye. They did not explain how they calculated this risk or how their conclusion factored into the Prime Minister\u2019s mandate to transition the open net-pens by 2025. They did admit, in response to a question, that they had not included sea lice from fish farms in their assessment. Well- established science shows that sea lice from fish farms kill out-migrating juvenile salmon.\n\nJust four days earlier, John Reynolds, an aquatic ecologist at Simon Fraser University and chair of the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada, the committee responsible for designating endangered species said: \u201cWe have an overwhelming weight of evidence from research coming at this from all different directions. The current open-net pen fish farm model that we have is not compatible with protecting wild fish.\u201d\n\nThankfully, one of DFO\u2019s top scientists is speaking out. Dr. Kristi Miller-Saunders, head of DFO\u2019s molecular genetics laboratory in Nanaimo and adjunct professor at the University of British Columbia, described how DFO\u2019s dual role as regulator and industry advocate, coupled with its reliance on industry funding for research, skews risk assessments in favour of the fish-farm industry. Let\u2019s watch what happens to Dr. Miller-Saunders now.\n\nIn the ten years DFO has regulated fish farming in B.C., a former B.C. Supreme Court judge, two Federal Court judges, the Auditor General\u2019s office, Canada\u2019s Chief Scientist, DFO\u2019s own scientists, B.C. First Nations, and numerous NGOs have all sounded the alarm. But, so far, the politicians have done nothing to reform the institution mismanaging wild Pacific salmon to extinction.\n\nOur leaders must act now and not wait to say, \u201cnever again,\u201d again.\n\n\u2013 Tony Allard, chair of Wild Salmon Forever",
