The $18-million project included a new building with drive-up access, affordable parking, a restaurant and a big blank wall destined for art.\n\nAirport Manager Carman Hendry says when the arts fest and gallery pitched a wall exhibition of rotating paintings, they were thrilled to cooperate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very happy to show art made in the community, to the community, right in our own backyard,\u201d Hendry says.\n\nThe first installation \u2014 the wall of paintings inside the main terminal \u2014 went up in August for four months. The works by regional artists Suzo Hickey\u200b, Lynn Cociani and Mark Tworow all illustrate the expansiveness of the water system surrounding YXT.\n\nNext, acrylic paintings by Manda Hugon and Marie-Christine Claveau will adorn the wall.\n\nThree display cases, two of which were donated by Rio Tinto, were also installed throughout the airport in December, as were carvings by Joerg Jung of JJs Woodart.\n\nThe prolific local artist carved regional tree species along with the wildlife that inhabit them \u2014 a red cedar with a wolverine, birch with an owl, alder with a beaver and hemlock with a red squirrel. Gordon says they will remain in the departure vestibule for one year.\n\n\u201cWhen we need to refresh it, we\u2019ll find something equally as exciting.\u201d\n\nThe rotating displays are great exposure for local artists, he adds.\n\n\u201cWe have a history of training artists who then move south to make a living,\u201d he says. \u201cBut our goal is to keep northwest artists living and working in the area.\n\n\u201cThe renovated Terrace airport creates opportunities for artists in the northwest and we hope as a result we can keep them here.\u201d",
