I\u2019ve loved and revered Alex Trebek since I can remember. What an iconic career. RIP Alex Trebek. \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) November 8, 2020\n\nAlex Trebek was kind enough to film a cameo for our film Free Guy last year despite his battle. He was gracious and funny. In addition to being curious, stalwart, generous, reassuring and of course, Canadian. We love you, Alex. And always will. \u2014 Ryan Reynolds (@VancityReynolds) November 8, 2020\n\nAlex's impact is immeasurable. Thank you for sharing, Burt! pic.twitter.com/XgGGwJ8GlH \u2014 Jeopardy!
